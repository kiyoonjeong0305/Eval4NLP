        "Chipotle Mexican Grill has partnered with Postmates, an app-based food delivery service, to offer delivery in 67 cities. This arrangement will allow customers to order Chipotle through online and mobile platforms. A service charge of nine percent will be applied on top of the delivery fees, which begin at $5 and may vary depending on distance and demand. Postmates operates using an independent contractor model, similar to Uber, where individuals drive their own cars for the delivery service.\n\nOriginal text: The fast-casual chain will work with the Postmates app to begin offering delivery for online and mobile orders in 67 cities, according to a report in Nation's Restaurant News. But Mexican food fans should know that the restaurant plans to add a nine per cent service charge - with the delivery fees for Postmates beginning at $5 and up, depending on distance and demand. The app hires independent contractors who drive their own cars in a similar model to Uber taxis.  \n \nChipotle and Postmates both refer to these delivery charges as \"service fee\" and \"delivery fee\" interchangeably. Customers are also reminded that this service is available within the city limits according to Chipotle's partnership with Postmates - it might not be available in all stores or within particular areas within the specified cities. \n\nIn terms of delivery options - customers have the choice of choosing the delivery time, selecting a delivery window of one hour or more, or opting to have their food delivered over a longer period of time (as long as 3 days) using the \"scheduled pickup\". \n\nIf users are not available to take the delivery, they can also choose the \"leave at my door\" option - in which the delivery person will leave the food at the doorstep. \n\nChipotle charges a service fee of 9%, on this fee, the cost of the delivery varies depending on distance and demand. The delivery fee for Postmates starts at $5 per delivery and goes up depending on distance and demand. Delivery will be charged in addition to the cost of the customer's meal. \n\nFor users to be able to place orders through Postmates and receive deliveries - they need to have a Chipotle account",
        "Chipotle, a fast-casual dining chain, plans to partner with the Postmates delivery app, starting a nine percent service charge to customers for online and mobile orders in 67 cities. Delivery fees will be determined by a combination of distance and demand and start at $5. Postmates operates on a model similar to Uber, utilizing independent contractors driving their own cars to deliver meals.### Response:\nThe core idea of the given aspect is that Chipotle is partnering with Postmates for enhanced delivery services to patrons, which will be charged with a nine percent service fee and a base delivery fee starting at $5. This service is set to cover customers in 67 cities within the United States.\n\n\nThe implementation of the charge aims to support the independent contractors working for Postmates, which also operates on a similar business model to Uber. The delivery fees, along with service charges, are calculated based on variables including distance and demand, meaning the actual costs could vary depending on the specific order and its destination. \n\nBoth Postmates and Uber largely rely on independent contractors who use their own vehicles for delivering services, a business model Chipotle and Postmates are adopting for this delivery venture. It is important to note that this new feature will not affect the pricing of their food items themselves, although customers can anticipate these delivery charges. \n\nThese arrangements allow customers to order for delivery from Chipotle through the Postmates app, thus offering more versatility to how they engage with the fast-casual dining chain. However, the charges might make the delivery option a bit more expensive, especially if it is a regular feature that customers rely on for their meals. But as a whole, the collaboration should enhance convenience and accessibility of Chipotleâ€™s offerings for those interested in having their meal delivered to them.</s>",
