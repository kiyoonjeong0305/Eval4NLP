        "Yes.\n\nThis sentence directly addresses Ross Barkley's decision to take the penalty shot instead of Leighton Baines, considering Baines' impressive record in doing so. \n\nThe sentence also implies potential criticism of management (coach Roberto Martinez) for not choosing Baines to take the potentially valuable, game-changing kick.

The summary provides enough data for the reader to understand the idea discussed in the aspect, and the aspect offers contextual information related to the broader topic. \n\nIt should be mentioned that while the aspect adds some additional information regarding Leighton Baines' successful conversion history, the summary's mention of Baines' reputation for successful penalties already informs the reader about that aspect.
