        "Yes, the core idea of the given aspect is shortened and aligned properly. It mentions that Kluivert's coaching strategies help Curacao in advancing during the 2018 World Cup qualification after having victories over Montserrat. \n\nThe summary gives off an understanding that Kluivert, as a coach, played a crucial role in assisting the Curacao's team's progress in the 2018 World Cup qualification by guiding them through some victories which are clearly identified in matches against Montserrat. \n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the summary aligns and corresponds with the core idea of the aspect.

Also, the aspect gives more information about Kluivert's role as a coach, which helped Curacao achieve its victories. So both the summary and aspect are complementary to each other, but the aspect elaborates more on Kluivert's strategies and role in the coaching. \n\nThe part about Kluivert's strategies or coaching tactics not covered in the summary, indicates that Kluivert's strategic approach made the team stand as victorious, hence advancing in the World Cup qualification process,",
