While the summary mentions Guffick's actions in altering the exam answers, it does not explicitly state that he altered his own answers, nor does it mention the consequences of his actions on the validity of the exam results and his lack of ethical behavior.",

Therefore, the given aspect is not directly reflected in the summary."
