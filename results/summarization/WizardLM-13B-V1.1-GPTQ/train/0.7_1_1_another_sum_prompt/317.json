        "A young accountant falls down a 70ft cliff while running from a taxi to avoid paying the fare.\n\nApply given aspect to the summary: The summary is about a young man named Jacob Phillips, who died after falling down a 70ft cliff while attempting to avoid paying a taxi fare. Mr. Phillips had caught a cab home after a night out with friends in December, but he didn't have enough cash to pay for it.

        "\nNo.\n\nAfter reading the summary word by word, I realize that the aspect mentioned does not appear in the original text. It seems to be an assumption based on the information provided. The aspect states that Jacob was chased by a taxi driver, which is not mentioned in the summary. The original text states that Jacob had caught a cab home after a night out with friends in December but did not have enough cash to pay for it. He was later found dead at the end of a disused northern promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff.\n\nWhile the summary does mention Jacob's death at the end of the disused northern promenade, it does not provide any context suggesting that he was chased by a taxi driver and then died as a result.",

        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect. While the summary itself does not explicitly mention Jacob Phillips' professional background or his occupation at Pretty Green, by stating that he was a graduate and an accountant, it provides some context about his life. Additionally, the mention of the disused northern promenade indicates that he might have been at a public place when the incident occurred.\n\nFurthermore, the summary clearly indicates that Jacob Phillips plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. This detail directly connects to the aspect's reference to his death following an attempt to avoid paying a taxi fare.
