        "To make comprehensible or clear; clarify.\n\nThe given aspect highlights that Arsene Wenger, the Manager of Arsenal, was aware of Liverpool's interest in Alexis Sanchez. However, it also suggests that Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona might have influenced the transfer. While it is unclear how exactly Suarez's move influenced the transfer, it can be inferred that his departure from Liverpool might have created a vacuum in their attacking lineup, which could have attracted Sanchez to Arsenal.
