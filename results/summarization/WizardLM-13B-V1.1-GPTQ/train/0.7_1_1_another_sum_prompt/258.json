        "\nNigel Pearson, Manager of Leicester City, has emphasized the need for his team to focus solely on their own performances and not worry about the results or form of their relegation-threatened rivals during the remaining matches of the season. By urging his players to stay focused on their own job and not be distracted by the competition around them, Pearson hopes to help Leicester secure positive results in the coming matches and maintain their position in the league.",
        "The aspect highlights that Jamie Vardy's injury-time winner against West Brom has improved Leicester City's chances of survival in the Premier League. This victory has provided the team with a slight boost in the fight against relegation.\n\nDiscuss how the core idea fits with the summary.\nThe victory against West Brom has given Leicester City a morale boost, which Pearson believes is crucial during the run-in. With a higher possibility of survival, the players can concentrate on their own performance instead of worrying about their relegation rivals. This will enable them to take their game to the next level and secure more wins in the remaining matches.",
        "It indicates that Leicester City Football Club is currently three points away from the safety zone in the Premier League table. The safety zone is the ranking that ensures a team's survival in the league for the following season. As a result, Leicester's upcoming game against Swansea City on Saturday, 16th May 2020, holds high stakes for them, as a win or a draw could help them move further away from the relegation zone and towards safety. With three points currently separating them from safety, Leicester needs to perform well in this match to secure their Premier League status for another season."

    "answer": [
        "\nI apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Upon closer examination, the summary does not clearly convey the core idea mentioned in the aspect. The aspect mentions Nigel Pearson urging Leicester to focus on their own game and not worry about relegation rivals, while the summary mentions Pearson urging his players to take their game to the next level and win their remaining matches. Although there is an element of focusing on their own performance in the summary, it does not directly address the aspect mentioned.",
        "No, the summary does not explicitly contain the core idea that the aspect discusses. However, there is an indirect connection as the team's improved chances of survival can motivate the players to perform better and focus on their own game, as mentioned in the summary.",
        "\nAfter examining the summary, I believe that it does not contain the core idea. The summary mentions Pearson urging his players to focus on their own job and not worry about their relegation rivals during the run-in, but it doesn't directly connect to Leicester's situation in the Premier League. While the aspect mentions that Leicester is three points from safety, the summary does not provide any information about Leicester's current position in the league table or their struggle to avoid relegation. Therefore, the core idea of the aspect seems to be missing from the summary."
