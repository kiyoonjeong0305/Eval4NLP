        "The summary does not contain the core idea. The core idea is not mentioned in the summary. The summary is a brief account of Ella Henderson being announced as the face of the dry shampoo brand Batiste, and her association with the brand's 'Ready for It' campaign in 2015. The aspect, however, focuses on the collaboration between Ella Henderson and Batiste as their official brand face.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea. Although the summary does mention Ella Henderson's involvement in the Batiste 's 2015 'Ready for It' campaign and showcases her wearing a black lacy dress with a black fringed leather jacket, it does not explicitly focus on the idea of showcasing her hairstyles with varying styles. The aspect highlights the campaign's emphasis on Ella Henderson's versatile hairstyles, while the summary only briefly touches upon her appearance and the brand.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea, which is Ella Henderson's excitement about the partnership with Batiste.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea that this is Ella Henderson's first endorsement deal.",
        "I apologize for the oversight. Upon reevaluating the summary, I see that my previous explanation was not entirely accurate. The summary only mentions that Ella Henderson is the face of Batiste's \"Ready for It\" campaign, but it does not mention anything about her being a brand ambassador or promoting their dry shampoo product. The campaign may still include her single \"Mirror Man\" in the TV advertisement, but there is no direct connection between Ella Henderson and the product itself in the given summary. My previous explanation was based on an incorrect assumption."
