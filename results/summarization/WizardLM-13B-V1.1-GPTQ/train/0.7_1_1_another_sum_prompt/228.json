The match also has a personal significance for Gareth Bale, who is expected to play a key role in the game, following his success in the Euro 2012 qualifier match against England at the Cardiff City Stadium. However, securing enough tickets might be difficult for some fans, as general admission tickets are sold out due to UEFA rules, while only a limited number of seats are available for purchase."
