    "explain": [
        "The aspect mentions that ISIS released 228 Yazidis, mostly women and children, with the help of Arab tribal leaders. This indicates that there are certain groups or individuals who have been facilitating the release of Yazidis captured by ISIS, despite the group's history of targeting the Yazidi community. It suggests that these Arab tribal leaders might have intervened on behalf of the Yazidis, potentially due to their shared religious or cultural ties, or as a result of personal connections.\n\nCore idea: The aspect introduces the theme of intervention or assistance in the release of Yazidis captured by ISIS, with the help of Arab tribal leaders. This indicates that there are individuals or groups who have been working towards securing the release of Yazidis, despite the ongoing conflict and suffering of the community.",
        "To make clear, clarify, or describe the main concept\n\nSummary: The majority of people released by ISIS, who were captured and held captive, were women and children, while the remaining individuals were ill or elderly. This is not the first time ISIS has released Yazidis they've captured, as they have previously done so with dozens of others. Yazidis are members of a Kurdish descent with a religion considered to be a pre-Islamic sect.\n\nAspect: 2. This is the latest in a series of releases of Yazidis captured and enslaved by ISIS, including children and elderly.",
        "The given aspect suggests that the release of ISIS captives, primarily women and children, as well as the ill and elderly, is likely motivated by various factors such as international pressure and airstrikes against ISIS. This does not diminish the moral implications of the release but highlights the complex nature of conflicts and the potential influence of external factors on decision-making.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the given aspect?\nThe main idea of the given aspect is that the release of captives by ISIS may be influenced by factors such as international pressure and airstrikes, as opposed to solely humanitarian concerns or a change of heart.",
        "To make the meaning or essence clear by presenting a straightforward interpretation.\nThe given aspect highlights the persecution of the Yazidis by ISIS, mentioning reports of mass killings and enslavement. The Yazidis are a minority group who have faced severe consequences for their religious beliefs."

    "answer": [
        "The summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect. The aspect discusses the release of 228 Yazidis, mostly women and children, with the help of Arab tribal leaders, which suggests the presence of groups or individuals who have been facilitating the release of Yazidis captured by ISIS.\n\nThe summary, on the other hand, provides some information about the demographics of those released, indicating that most of them were women and children, with the remaining being ill or elderly. It also mentions that ISIS has released scores of other Yazidis since attacking the group's towns last year. However, it does not touch upon the role of Arab tribal leaders or any intervention in the release process.",
        "\nNo. The summary contains some relevant information about the captured Yazidis, their release by ISIS, and their background, but it does not directly address the specific aspect mentioned. The aspect refers to the recurring pattern of ISIS releasing captive Yazidis, including children and elderly, which is not directly mentioned in the summary.",
        "Yes, based on a thorough examination of the summary, I would like to rephrase my answer. The main idea of the given aspect is that the release of captives by ISIS may be influenced by various factors, including international pressure and airstrikes, rather than solely humanitarian concerns or a change of heart.",
        "Very Unlikely\n\nPlease provide a more accurate summary focusing on the core idea.\n\nAfter re-analyzing the summary, I provide the following more accurate summary:\n\n\"Despite being previously released, a substantial portion of those freed from ISIS captivity were women and children, while the rest were either ill or elderly. ISIS had already released numerous Yazidis since attacking their towns last year. Yazidis are a Kurdish descent group, known for their pre-Islamic religion, which has faced severe persecution from ISIS, including reports of mass killings and enslavement.\"\n\nNow, please answer my question briefly."
