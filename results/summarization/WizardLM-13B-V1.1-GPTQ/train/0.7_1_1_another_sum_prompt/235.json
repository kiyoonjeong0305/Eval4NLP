By teaming up with Postmates and implementing a nine percent service charge on deliveries, Chipotle aims to tap into the growing food delivery market while maintaining their commitment to providing high-quality ingredients and customer experience.",

        "Yes, the summary contains the core idea. The summary provides the main points and highlights that Chipotle is entering the food delivery market in partnership with Postmates, with a 9% service charge and delivery fees starting at $5.",
        "Yes, I apologize for my previous response. After a more careful inspection of the summary, I realize that the core idea is not accurately reflected. Upon revisiting the summary and aspect, it appears that Chipotle initially rejected offers to enter the food delivery market due to their focus on the in-store dining experience. However, they have now joined forces with Postmates to experiment with delivery, adding a nine percent service charge for the convenience of customers. The Postmates model, similar to transportation apps like Uber, allows Chipotle to test the delivery waters without compromising their brand image.",
        "\n\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea as it only mentions Chipotle's decision to enter the food delivery market through a partnership with an app like Postmates. While Chipotle is one of the mentioned restaurants that is testing delivery services, it does not provide a comprehensive picture of the other restaurants that are also exploring or have already started delivery services. The aspect you provided discusses six major fast-food and chain restaurants that are either testing or planning delivery services to cash in on the growing delivery market.",
        "\n\nI apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Upon closer examination of the summary, the aspect mentioning Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio as Chipotle's celebrity customers does not seem to directly relate to the main idea expressed in the summary. Thus, the core idea in the given summary and aspect does not seem to be adequately expressed in the response.\n\nTo provide a more accurate response, I will resume the core idea as follows:\n\nThe given summary discusses Chipotle's entry into the $70 billion food delivery market through a partnership with an app. Chipotle plans to impose a 9% service charge on deliveries, with fees starting at $5 for Postmates, depending on the distance and demand. The aspect states that Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio are among Chipotle's celebrity customers, which may imply the restaurant's popularity despite various controversies and health concerns affecting its sales."
