During the match, he accidentally ripped a hole in his trousers. Despite this minor setback, Bayern's performance was outstanding, leaving their European rivals feeling apprehensive about facing them in future competitions.",

Additionally, it offers an opportunity for humor or satire, as it adds a lighthearted touch to the otherwise serious situation of a football manager's wardrobe malfunction. However, it is important to note that the main focus should remain on the summary and the achievement of Bayern Munich in the Champions League match, as the underwear detail serves as a secondary or ancillary aspect.",

        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea. Although the summary mentions Pep Guardiola's ripped trousers, it does not emphasize that his clothing incident was a minor detail in the context of Bayern Munich's outstanding performance in the Champions League match against Porto. Additionally, the summary does not mention the impact of Bayern's performance on their European rivals.",
        "No, I do not believe the summary contains the core idea. While the summary mentions Pep Guardiola tearing a hole in his trousers during a Champions League match in Germany and Bayern Munich's outstanding display, it does not highlight the detail about Guardiola's underwear being visible. As such, I believe the aspect is an additional piece of information that adds interest and context to the story.",
