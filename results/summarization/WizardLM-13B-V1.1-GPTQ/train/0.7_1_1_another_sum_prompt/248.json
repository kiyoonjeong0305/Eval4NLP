        "Describe the aspect in detail, providing context, background, and relevance.\n\nExplain the given aspect, i.e., Patrick Kluivert's experience as an assistant coach for Louis van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nPatrick Kluivert, the current coach of Curacao, had previously served as an assistant coach for the Dutch national team during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil under the guidance of head coach, Louis van Gaal. This experience working with Van Gaal, who was known for his organized and defensive style of play, may have influenced Kluivert's coaching approach with Curacao. This World Cup was Van Gaal's first major international tournament as a head coach and it culminated in the Netherlands reaching the round of 16. By working closely with Van Gaal during this time, Kluivert gained valuable insights into his coaching philosophy and tactical approaches.\n\nAs Curacao coach, Kluivert has led the team to a successful start in World Cup qualifying, advancing to the second qualifying round in Concacaf for the 2018 tournament. Their recent draw at Montserrat in a second-leg match secured a 4-3 aggregate win and progression to the next round. It is possible that Kluivert's experience working with Van Gaal provided him with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complexities of international football management, and contributed to his successful tenure with Curacao."
