Considering the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, major changes have been made to the scheduling and preparation of the preseason for many football clubs. Pre-season tours, in particular, have been affected by these changes, with teams focusing on hosting opposing teams instead. However, it appears that Chelsea is considering an alternative approach by visiting Japan this summer. This move could be beneficial for multiple reasons.\n\nFirstly, it could be a strategic decision to expand the club's fan base in Japan. Chelsea has a significant following in the country, as evidenced by the support Yoshinori Muto received when joining the club. By organizing a pre-season tour, Chelsea can engage with its Japanese fans, giving them a chance to watch the team live. The club can also create opportunities for local youth players to train with Chelsea's academy talent, fostering new talent and strengthening the club's presence in the country.\n\nSecondly, a pre-season tour can help Chelsea acclimate to different playing conditions and time zones. Playing friendly matches against local teams in Japan can help the players adapt to the climate and recover from the jet lag before starting the competitive season. This preparation could give Chelsea a competitive edge in the upcoming season, allowing the team to perform at its best.\n\nLastly, a pre-season tour of Japan could be a means for Chelsea to forge partnerships with local clubs and organizations. By collaborating with Japanese teams and sports institutions, Chelsea can exchange knowledge and expertise, facilitating future collaboration and potentially enhancing its global reputation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the aspect highlights Chelsea's possible pre-season tour of Japan this summer, the core idea is that it represents a unique approach to pre-season preparation. A visit to Japan could offer numerous benefits to the club, such as expanding its fan base, preparing players for the season, and fostering partnerships in the country."
