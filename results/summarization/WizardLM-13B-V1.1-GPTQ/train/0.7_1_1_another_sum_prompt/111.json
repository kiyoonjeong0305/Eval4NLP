    "explain": [
        "Nigel Pearson, the manager of Leicester City, has emphasized the importance of his team focusing on their own performance and not paying attention to their relegation-threatened rivals. He has encouraged the players to maintain their composure and not get distracted by the pressure of the situation. This approach will help Leicester remain focused on taking the necessary steps to preserve their Premier League status.",
        "To emphasize or summarize an important point or concept. In this case, the core idea is that Leicester City will host Swansea City in a pivotal Premier League match on Saturday, with the chance to move further from relegation. Leicester has won their last two matches, providing them with a survival lifeline, and they must capitalize on this momentum to secure their Premier League status.",
        "The given aspect is that Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Brom, which improved Leicester's slim chance of survival. This means that Vardy's goal had an essential impact on Leicester's fight against relegation from the Barclays Premier League. The late goal not only secured a much-needed three points but also provided a significant morale boost for the team. Furthermore, Vardy's heroics highlighted his crucial contribution to the team's efforts in avoiding relegation. Leicester's slim chance of survival was dramatically enhanced by this crucial victory, as it moved them closer to the safety zone with just three points separating them from the 17th-placed team.",
        "To paraphrase, Pearson desires for Leicester City to remain composed and centered on their own performance, refraining from paying attention to the outcomes of other teams in the league.\n\nFurthermore, it is important for Leicester to maintain their focus on their own job and not be influenced by external factors, such as the results or performances of other teams, in order to stay on track towards their goal of Premier League survival. By focusing on their own game, Leicester can better execute their game plan and increase their chances of securing wins, which is crucial for their relegation battle."
