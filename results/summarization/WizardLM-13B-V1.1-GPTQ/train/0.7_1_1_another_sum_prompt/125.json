This can be seen as an example of fulfilling responsibilities as a captain and professional athlete. It can be inferred that the managers, Brendan Rodgers in this case, are discussing the importance of responsibility with younger players like Sterling and Ibe, helping them understand the demands and expectations that come with being a professional athlete. While there isn't an explicit mention of responsibility in the summary, the concept can be indirectly linked to the core idea of responsibility in professional sports.\n\nIn conclusion, while the summary doesn't directly address the core idea of responsibility in the context of professional athletes, it does provide some indirect hints and examples that relate to this concept.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect.

        "\n\nI should be careful while answering, so I'll say maybe, based on the given summary. The summary does mention that Gerrard is unavailable for the match, but it does not explicitly state that he was available. Therefore, the core idea of the aspect may not be entirely captured in the summary. However, if we consider the possibility that Gerrard was indeed available despite being unsuitable for selection due to his behavior, then the summary could be considered to contain the core idea of the aspect. Ultimately, it depends on the interpretation of the information offered in the summary.",
        "\n\nThe summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect. Although the summary discusses an unavailable player and the consequences of being a professional, it does not directly address the idea of learning from losses to achieve success.
