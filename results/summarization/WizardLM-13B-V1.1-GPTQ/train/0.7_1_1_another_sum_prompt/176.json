        "\nYes, the summary does not explicitly mention the timeline of the pregnancy, but it does briefly mention that within ten minutes of the upcoming episode, fans will see Ross Poldark gazing lovingly at his new baby daughter. This suggests that the event of Demelza giving birth to their baby will happen within that episode, which supports the idea that the baby's birth is a significant event in the storyline, and the aspect is correctly identified within the summary.",

The aspect states that fans long for Ross Poldark despite his heart being off the market, which is supported by the mention of the new addition to the show (Demelza's baby) and Ross's loving gaze towards the baby. The summary also touches upon the unconvincing timeline of Demelza's pregnancy, but this is not the primary focus of the aspect.",
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea as discussed. While it mentions the criticisms about the pregnancy timeline, it does not give specific information about its unusual speed or the disbelief of the viewers.",

The summary mentions the new addition to the show, but it does not explore the emotional connection between the character and the audience."
