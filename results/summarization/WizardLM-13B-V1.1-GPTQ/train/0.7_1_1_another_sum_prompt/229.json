        "\nYes, the summary contains the core idea mentioned in the aspect. Although the summary emphasizes more on Lindegaard sharing a link to Beqiri's Instagram account, it does mention that he enjoyed the sunshine with his wife. By mentioning that Lindegaard took advantage of the good weather, the summary indirectly highlights the core idea that Lindegaard enjoyed spending time with his wife in the sunshine.",
        "\nNo, the summary does not directly contain the core idea of the aspect that Lindegaard and Beqiri tied the knot in Mauritius in 2015. While it mentions Lindegaard's social media activity and his relationship with Beqiri, it does not provide significant details about their wedding ceremony or their personal life.

        "I apologize for my previous response, as I misunderstood the summary. Upon closer examination, the summary does not explicitly state the core idea of the 4th aspect provided. The summary mentions that Lindegaard moved to Manchester United in 2010 from Aalesunds in Norway without providing any context about his career or success at the club. I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused, and I will provide a revised explanation after thoroughly reviewing the summary.",
        "\nNo, I do not believe the summary contains the core idea as it does not mention the aspect of Bajra Qeri being a Swedish model with Albanian roots. The summary mainly focuses on Anders Lindegaard's connection with Qeri on Instagram during rainy weather and his career as a Manchester United goalkeeper, without mentioning Qeri's cultural background.",
        "Yes, the summary contains the core idea of the aspect quite accurately. The line \"Lindegaard moved to the Premier League in 2010 after signing from Norwegian side Aalesunds but has failed to make an impact\" suggests that the goalkeeper has struggled to establish himself and make a lasting impression at the club, which aligns with the notion of \"Lindegaard struggles for playing time at United.\"",
        "Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Upon re-examining the summary, I realize that the aspect \"He was linked with a move to FC Midtjylland in January\" is only mentioned in passing and may not be the central idea. Instead, the main focus of the summary appears to be on Anders Lindegaard's interaction with a fellow Danish footballer, Misse Bregar, and his promotion of her Instagram account. Lindegaard's move from Aalesunds to Manchester United in 2010 and his lack of impact since then are also mentioned. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and will ensure a more careful examination in future answers."
