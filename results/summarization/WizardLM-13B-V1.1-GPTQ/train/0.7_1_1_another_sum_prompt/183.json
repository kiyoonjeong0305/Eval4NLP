    "explain": [
        "To give a detailed description or account of something, focusing on the essential features or main points.\n\nBased on the given summary and aspect, the core idea is that Radamel Falcao completed a season-long loan move to Manchester United last summer. This loan move was expected to help Falcao regain his form and confidence after a serious knee injury, but it seems that he has struggled to adapt to the Premier League. Despite this, his loan deal expires this summer, and Manchester United has the option to make his transfer permanent by paying a fee of £46 million.\n\nIt's interesting to note that Falcao wasn't happy playing for his previous club, Monaco, and according to his former team-mate Nabil Dirar, he might be regretting his failed loan move to Manchester United, as he has not been able to live up to his previous success due to his knee injury.",
        "Falcao's struggle to find his form and scoring four goals this season can be attributed to his serious knee injury. He has not fully recovered from the injury, which has affected his performance and productivity. This injury suffered during his time at Monaco has likely contributed to his dissatisfaction with his experiences at Manchester United, despite not being content in France beforehand. The uncertainty of his future at the club and the potential #46 million fee to make his transfer permanent adds to the complexity of his situation.",
        "To make clear or evident; to set forth in detail.\n\nSummary: Radamel Falcao, a former striker for Monaco, had a failed loan move to Manchester United. Although Falcao was not happy in France, Nabil Dirar, Falcao's former teammate, believes he may be regretting this decision. Falcao struggled to reach the heights he achieved before his serious knee injury in his time at United. The club would need to pay £46 million to make Falcao's transfer permanent.\n\nAspect: 3. Nabil Dirar, Falcao's former teammate, thinks Falcao would have been better off staying at Monaco, where he would have played more and participated in the Champions League.\n\nIn a nutshell, the given aspect highlights Nabil Dirar's opinion that Falcao could have better benefited from staying at Monaco, where he could have enjoyed more playing time and participated in the Champions League. This suggestion implies that Falcao might have had better opportunities for success if he had stayed at his former club. However, it's important to note that Falcao had a serious knee injury prior to his time at United, which may have limited his performance regardless of his club choice."
