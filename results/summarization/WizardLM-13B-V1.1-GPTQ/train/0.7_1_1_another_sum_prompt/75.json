    "answer": [
        "No, I don't think the summary fully contains the core idea. While it mentions that Gregory van der Wiel is denying the claims of leaving PSG in the summer, it does not explicitly highlight his love for the club or his intentions to stay at PSG.",
        "Yes, I think the summary contains the core idea regarding van der Wiel's decision to stay at Paris Saint-Germain despite having a falling out with his coach Laurent Blanc. While it doesn't directly address van der Wiel's mental strength or resilience, it does mention that he is happy in Paris and has no plans to leave the club. This is consistent with the aspect provided, which states that van der Wiel had a falling out with Blanc but remains committed to the club.",
        "\n\nYes, there is a hint in the summary that Gregory van der Wiel may be looking to sign a new contract, as it mentions he is \"making no plans to leave the Ligue 1 side.\" However, this is not the main focus of the summary, which primarily revolves around addressing the claims that the player will be leaving Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. The core idea of the summary is thus the denial of the player's departure, while the aspect you provided gives more depth into Van der Wiel's intentions with the club.",
        "After reevaluating the summary, it is evident that it does not directly address the core idea of the provided aspect. The summary only mentions Gregory van der Wiel's recent falling out with Laurent Blanc and his happiness in Paris, without directly discussing the possibility of him leaving due to Dani Alves' arrival. Thus, it cannot be concluded that the summary accurately conveys the core idea."
