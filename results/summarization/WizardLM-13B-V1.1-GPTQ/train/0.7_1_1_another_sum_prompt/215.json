        "In 2014, Donald Sterling, the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was recorded making racist remarks towards African Americans. After the recording was made public, the NBA took swift action and banned him from the league, ultimately leading to the sale of his team.\n\nApply aspect to given summary.\nThe given summary discusses the legal dispute between V. Stiviano and Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling, Donald Sterling's wife. The lawsuit centers around the allegation that Stiviano targeted wealthy older men, as mentioned in the aspect. While Donald Sterling's racist remarks did not directly cause the dispute, the lawsuit occurred after the scandal that resulted in the loss of his NBA team.",

        "\nThe case of V. Stiviano versus Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling sets a legal precedent in which injured spouses can potentially recover damages from individuals who have received gifts from the spouses. This case involves Donald Sterling, the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, who was ousted from the NBA due to his racist remarks. V. Stiviano, Sterling's former companion, was accused by Sterling's wife, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling, of targeting extremely wealthy older men to be her benefactors. In her lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling claimed that V. Stiviano had been gifted millions of dollars by her husband, which was a violation of her marital rights. The judge's ruling in this case sets a legal precedent that allows spouses to seek restitution for damages incurred due to gifts given to third parties without the spouse's consent. The precedent may have significant implications in similar cases where spouses claim their marital rights have been violated through extra-marital relationships and gift-giving.",
