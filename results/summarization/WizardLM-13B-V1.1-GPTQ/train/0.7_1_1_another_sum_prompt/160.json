    "answer": [
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect. Although the summary mentions that Hull City lost to Southampton and are just two points clear of the relegation zone, it does not highlight Steve Bruce's determination to keep the team in the Premier League or his confidence in his ability to do so.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea as it only mentions Hull City's recent defeat and their current position in the Premier League table. It does not provide detail on the specific number of wins Bruce believes is necessary for survival, which is the focus of the aspect.",
        "Yes, I do not believe the summary contains the core idea mentioned in the aspect. While the summary mentions Hull City's defeat by Southampton at St. Mary's Stadium, it does not emphasize the specific challenges that Hull faces in terms of fixtures or the impact of this loss on their struggle against relegation. The aspect, on the other hand, highlights both the recent setback of the loss and the series of tough matches that Hull will face as a result.",
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect because while it mentions Steve Bruce's side losing to Southampton and currently being just two points clear of the relegation zone, it does not specifically highlight Bruce's positive attitude towards turning the team's fortune around. The summary only mentions that Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season, which is a broader statement.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea. Although the summary mentions that Hull City were beaten 2-0 by Southampton at St. Mary's on Saturday and that they are just two points clear of the relegation zone, it does not explicitly state that the team's struggles are due to injuries to key players. The aspect explicitly highlights this factor as a crucial reason for Hull City's performance.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea.\n\nReason: The summary focuses primarily on Hull City's loss to Southampton and their current position in the Premier League, rather than highlighting Southampton's achievement of moving up to 5th place. Although the aspect mentions Ronald Koeman, the coach of Southampton, it does not provide enough information to determine his impact on the team's performance or how they were able to improve their position in the table."
