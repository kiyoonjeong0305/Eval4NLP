At the age of 12, he made a decision that would shape his future trajectory, which was to reject a move to Barcelona's renowned La Masia academy. This rejection was not an impulsive decision, as it was made after careful consideration from his family. Specifically, his family wanted him to continue his studies, as his academic performances were equally important to them, and they feared that moving to Barcelona would disrupt his education. This choice clearly demonstrates Patoulidis' maturity and dedication to both his football and academic pursuits, a rare combination in youth athletes. The consequences of this decision will likely have a lasting impact on his career, as it has already garnered the attention of top European clubs like Manchester City, who are now interested in signing him.",

Patoulidis, a 16-year-old Belgian starlet, has caught the attention of many top clubs with his exceptional talent.

By signing Patoulidis, Pellegrini aims to groom the young player and nurture his talent, ensuring that Manchester City remains a contender in the Premier League and European competitions for years to come."
