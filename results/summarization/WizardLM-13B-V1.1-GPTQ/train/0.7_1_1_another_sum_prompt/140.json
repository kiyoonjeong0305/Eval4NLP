        "This aspect is highlighting the cause of Jacob Phillips' death. Phillips, aged 23, died after leaping over a fence in the dark while drunk. He fell down a cliff and was found at the base of the disused Northern Promenade. His impulsive actions led to his tragic demise.",
        "In the given summary, Jacob Phillips, a 23-year-old man, died after accidentally falling down a cliff while trying to jump over a fence in the dark. The incident took place in Penarth, a seaside town in Wales. The inquest revealed that Mr. Phillips had been out with friends in Cardiff, and they had taken a taxi together before his unfortunate death. It was revealed during the inquest that the taxi driver, who was Padraig Crowley, had attempted to chase Phillips after he ran away from the cab. However, the driver couldn't see where he was going in the dark, which contributed to Phillips' accidental death. The term “accidental death” means the death that resulted from unintentional causes and not from any criminal activity."
