        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea. The aspect discusses an additional claim of inappropriate behavior at Clarence House, involving a former royal footman who claims that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in 1978. While this claim is not directly related to the protagonist's experience in terms of time or location, it still contributes to the overall narrative of potential misconduct within Clarence House. Furthermore, the occurrence of multiple allegations strengthens the possibility of a culture of sexual abuse or harassment within the royal household environment. Therefore, the core idea of the aspect is indeed present in the summary.",

The aspect explains that Christopher Lawler's initial complaints were ignored by palace officials for months before they were eventually reported to the police.
