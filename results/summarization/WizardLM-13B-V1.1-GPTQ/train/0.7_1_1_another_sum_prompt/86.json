        "1. 13 glowing blue letters from Yankee Stadium fail to find a buyer at Sotheby's auction, despite an estimated value of $300,000 to $600,000.",
        "2. Reggie Jackson, a 68-year-old Yankee, purchases the 13 letters for an undisclosed amount and wants 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and New York City.'",
        "3. Jackson bought the letters 'on a lark' and joked about the size upon realizing the purchase. He promises to visit the winner in the US if they're a domestic buyer.",
        "4. Sotheby's auction includes Yankee Stadium letters and a Mets bullpen car. The Mets memorabilia sells for $112,500, while the letters fail to attract any bids."

        "\nThe core idea of the given aspect is that the 13 glowing blue letters from Yankee Stadium failed to attract any buyer despite being expected to fetch a price in the range of $300,000 to $600,000 during an auction at Sotheby's. Although the letters were seen as an attractive and valuable piece of sports memorabilia, they surprisingly failed to generate any interest among potential bidders. This outcome might suggest that the auctioned objects did not meet the expectations of the bidders or that the estimated price range was unrealistic.",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that Reggie Jackson, the 68-year-old Yankee who purchased the 13 letters, is looking to pass on the ownership of the iconic signage to a new generation. He wishes for a new generation to appreciate and enjoy the significance of the Yankees and New York City. By remaining undisclosed about the purchase price, Jackson is allowing the new owners to create their own memories and connections with the signage without being influenced by its market value.",
        "This aspect highlights Reggie Jackson's purchase of the Yankee Stadium's \"NY\" letters as an impulsive and somewhat whimsical decision. Jackson purchased the letters without necessarily intending to make a sizable profit, and his initial reaction upon realizing the size of the purchase was to make a joke about it. This casual attitude towards the purchase is indicative of Jackson's playful side, and adds a personal touch to the story of the iconic signage. The fact that he is willing to visit the domestic buyer, if they are the lucky winner, further emphasizes his connection to the letters and his desire to engage with fans.",
        "The given aspect highlights the difference in the auction results for two items from the same auction by Sotheby's – the Yankee Stadium letters and a Mets bullpen car. The article states that while the bullpen car sold for $112,500, the Yankee Stadium letters failed to attract any bids, which suggests there was a lack of interest in the letters among the bidders present or participating via the online platform. This outcome may have been influenced by the estimated value of the letters, which was expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000. The difference in the auction results could also be due to factors such as rarity, condition, and personal preferences among potential buyers."

        "\nYes, the summary contains the core idea of the given aspect. It mentions that the 13 glowing blue letters from Yankee Stadium were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000 when sold at the Sotheby's auction, but unfortunately, they failed to find a buyer despite the anticipated value. This surprising outcome highlights the disconnect between the expectations and the market's response, which is the core idea of the aspect.",
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect. Although the summary briefly mentions Reggie Jackson as the current owner of the signage and his intention to sell it for a profit, it does not mention his intention to pass on the ownership to a new generation or allow the new owners to create their own memories without being influenced by the purchase price. Instead, the summary focuses on the expected revenue and the fact that Jackson purchased the letters after the stadium's final game in 2008.",
        "\nThe summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the given aspect. It only provides some general information about the signage, its current owner Reggie Jackson, and the expected revenue from its sale. The aspect, on the other hand, focuses on Jackson's impulsive purchase and humorous reaction to the size of the letters, as well as his willingness to visit the domestic winner if they buy the \"NY\" signs.",
        "Apologies for my previous response. Upon reevaluating the summary, I realize that I made an error in my understanding. The summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect. The given aspect highlights the difference in the auction results for two items from the same auction by Sotheby's – the Yankee Stadium letters and a Mets bullpen car. The article states that while the bullpen car sold for $112,500, the Yankee Stadium letters failed to attract any bids, which suggests there was a lack of interest in the letters among the bidders present or participating via the online platform. The summary, however, only mentions the expected revenue of $300,000 to $600,000 from the 13 letters, and an undisclosed amount paid by Reggie Jackson, the current owner. Therefore, the core idea of the given aspect is not present in the summary."
