        "I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. Upon reevaluating the summary, I realized that I misunderstood the relationship between Eden Hazard and John Terry's actions in the summary.

        "Yes, I REALLY think the summary contains the core idea. Although it does not explicitly state that there was a foul during the build-up, it mentions that Terry has scored a goal for Manchester United \"in the build-up to Eden Hazard.\" This implication suggests that there might have been a foul or some other infringement that affected the play leading up to Hazard's goal, which is in line with the pundits' belief. Therefore, while the summary does not directly mention a foul, it does provide enough context for the core idea to emerge.",
        "Sorry, after thoroughly inspecting the summary, I realized that my previous response was incorrect. The summary does not contain the core idea presented in the aspect, which is John Terry's challenge sending Radamel Falcao to the ground and starting the scoring play for Chelsea."
