    "explain": [
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that a passenger in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport was hospitalized due to an incident where he broke a toilet while squatting on it, resulting in injuries to his leg and buttocks. The situation highlights the potential hazards of using public restrooms and raises concerns about the quality of infrastructure in such facilities. This incident may also emphasize the importance of maintaining proper etiquette and ensuring the safety of oneself and others when using shared facilities.",
        "The aspect mentions that Jin Pai was standing on the rim of the toilet when it collapsed. This could imply that the toilet was designed to withstand only a certain amount of weight or pressure, and when Jin Pai, who was heavier or exerted more force than anticipated, stood on the rim, it led to the toilet's collapse. This also highlights the potential risks of standing on the toilet rim, as it may not be a stable or safe option for support.",
        "\nThe core idea of the given aspect is that the man in the summary was too ashamed to admit his mistake and seek assistance directly, so he opted for a more indirect approach of calling his traveling companions to request help. This shows the consequences of being too embarrassed to ask for help, as it can lead to more complexity and delays in resolving issues.",
        "The man in the summary was too embarrassed to ask for help after breaking the toilet he was squatting on, which led to him injuring himself. However, he eventually received stitches for his injuries at a hospital in Hefei. This highlights the importance of seeking medical attention or seeking help from others in times of need, even if it may be embarrassing or difficult. It is crucial to put personal pride aside in such instances to ensure one's well-being and safety. The hospital visit and treatment indicate that the man did eventually take responsibility for his injuries, even though it took an emotional and physical toll.",
        "The man initially confessed to squatting but later changed his story to the police.\n\nCore Idea: The aspect highlights the change in the man's story about the cause of the broken toilet, despite initially admitting to squatting on it.",
        "The authorities' stance on the incident, asserting that it was unintentional, despite the passenger's attempt to shift blame onto himself.\n\nSummary: A passenger was found to have broken a toilet he was squatting on, and he was too embarrassed to shout for help and instead blamed it on his own stupidity. Aspect: 6. Authorities believe the incident was an accident.\n\nAssistant\n\nHow did the passenger's behavior contribute to the incident?\nHe was too embarrassed to ask for help, so he blamed himself instead.\n\nHow did the authorities determine that the incident was an accident?\nThey analyzed the evidence and found no indication of malicious intent.\n\nWhat is the implication of the authorities' stance on the passenger's action?\nThe authorities believe that the passenger's attempt to shift blame onto himself was a result of embarrassment rather than intentional wrongdoing.",

    "answer": [
        "The given summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. While the summary mentions a passenger being embarrassed and blaming his own stupidity, it does not provide information about the passenger being hospitalized, nor does it mention any details about the incident involving the broken toilet. The aspect highlights the potential hazards and injuries sustained by the passenger in the public restroom, whereas the summary focuses on the passenger's emotional response.",
        "\nThe summary suggests that a passenger was using the toilet and, unintentionally, broke it while squatting on it. The passenger felt embarrassed and didn't call for help, instead blaming the incident on his own stupidity. The aspect provided does not seem to be central to this story, as it describes an unrelated incident involving a different passenger who was standing on the rim of the toilet when it collapsed.",
        "\nYes, I believe the given summary does contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary states that the passenger broke a toilet while squatting on it, was too embarrassed to shout for help, and instead blamed the incident on his own stupidity. This indirectly led him to call his traveling companions instead of seeking immediate assistance. Thus, the summary showcases the consequences of being too ashamed to ask for help, which resulted in a more indirect and potentially complex solution to the problem.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea. The core idea is that when faced with an embarrassing situation, the passenger in the summary was initially hesitant to seek help or admit to his mistake, but ultimately received medical attention and accepted responsibility for his actions after suffering injuries.",
        "I apologize for my previous response. Upon re-evaluating the summary, I noticed that I misunderstood the aspect. The aspect is actually \n\nAspect: 5.

        "Yes, I believe the summary contains the core idea, which is that a passenger broke a toilet while using it and was too embarrassed to seek help, so he blamed it on his own stupidity. The aspect states that authorities believe the incident was an accident, suggesting that the passenger's actions were unintentional and not due to malice.",
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the given aspect. Although the aspect talks about the importance of extracting relevant information while paraphrasing or summarizing a text, the summary itself already contains irrelevant information, such as the age of the passenger and their travel companions. This goes against the notion of focusing on the main points of the original text.\n\nThe correct answer should have been \"No, the summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the given aspect.\""
