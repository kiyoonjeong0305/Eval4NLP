    "answer": [
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea. The sentence \"But van der Wiel insists he 's happy in paris and wants to sign a new contract. \" conveys van der Wiel's intention to stay with the club and potentially sign a new contract, supporting the core idea that he denies leaving PSG in the summer. While the summary and aspect both mention Gregory van der Wiel and Paris Saint-Germain, the aspect focuses specifically on his denial of leaving in the summer, which is addressed in the summary as well.",
        "No, I do not think the summary contains the core idea of the aspect provided. Although the summary mentions van der Wiel's happiness in Paris and his desire to sign a new contract, it does not directly address his feelings about the club, teammates, and city. Rather, it mentions a falling out with the team's manager Laurent Blanc, suggesting that the aspect might have been overlooked or not emphasized in the summary.",
        "Upon reevaluating the summary, I apologize for my previous response. The summary does not directly address Gregory van der Wiel's contract situation. Instead, it discusses his feelings about leaving Paris Saint-Germain and his relationship with his boss, Laurent Blanc. However, it does mention that he recently had a falling out with Laurent Blanc. I must clarify that the given aspect does not pertain to Gregory van der Wiel's contract situation, but rather his availability and readiness to play for the team when called upon.",
