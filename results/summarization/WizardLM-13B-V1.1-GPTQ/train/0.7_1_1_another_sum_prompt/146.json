    "explain": [
        "13 glowing blue letters from Yankee Stadium were auctioned at Sotheby's, but there were no other bids",
        "Reggie Jackson, a hall of famer and former Yankee player, purchased the 13 letters that once hung over Yankee Stadium for an undisclosed amount in 2008. His intention was to give \"a new generation to own and enjoy this icon.\"\n\nCore Idea: Reggie Jackson's purchase of the Yankee Stadium letters in 2008 was motivated by his desire to pass on the iconic signage to the next generation, allowing them to appreciate and own it.",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that Reggie Jackson, the current owner of the 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium, attended the Sotheby's auction where the signage was up for sale. However, he joked about purchasing the letters \"on a lark\" (impulsively or for fun), suggesting that he may not have been serious about selling them. This aspect helps paint a more complete picture of Jackson's feelings towards the signage and adds a touch of humor to the situation.",
        "In summary, the 13 letters hanged over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000 at a Sotheby's auction. However, there were no bids and the only person who raised a paddle was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump-start the bidding. Reggie Jackson, a Yankee Hall of Famer, purchased the 10-foot-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium's final game in 2008. If the letters were bought by an American bidder, Jackson had promised to visit the winner in the US.",
        "The aspect highlights that the auction featured items related to the Mets baseball team, including a bullpen car that sold for $112,500. This piece of memorabilia added to the diversity of items available at the Sotheby's auction, which primarily focused on Yankee Stadium-related items. The presence of Mets memorabilia showcases the interest in collecting items from other teams as well."

        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea.\n\nHow would you summarize the aspect?\nSummary: 13 glowing blue letters from Yankee Stadium auctioned at Sotheby's for $260,000 with no other bids.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea. While the summary does mention that Reggie Jackson purchased the 13 letters for an undisclosed amount and wanted \"a new generation to own and enjoy this icon,\" it does not explore the reasons for his decision or the purpose of passing on the signage to the next generation.",
        "\nYes ☑️",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is not directly present in the summary, but it can be inferred from the information provided. While the summary mentions that Reggie Jackson purchased the letters and made the promise to visit the winner in the US if the letters were bought by an American bidder, there is no direct statement about Americans not bidding on the letters. Therefore, the summary alone does not convey the core idea.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea from the aspect. The aspect mentions a bullpen car from the Mets baseball team being sold at the Sotheby's auction, but there is no mention of it in the summary. The summary is focused on the lack of interest in purchasing the \"no love\" signage and the effort made by a Sotheby's employee to increase bidding."
