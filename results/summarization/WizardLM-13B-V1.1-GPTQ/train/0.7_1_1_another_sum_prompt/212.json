        "To make comprehensible the essential nature or meaning of something by providing an explanation or clarification.\n\nSummary: The summary discusses the case of Luigi Costa, who is accused of murdering his elderly neighbor, Terence Freebody, in 2012. Costa is said to have stomped on Freebody's head, cut his throat, and stabbed him multiple times in the dining room of his home in Red Hill, Canberra. The case's outcome depends largely on Costa's mental state at the time of the murder, as indicated by Professor Mullen's testimony.\n\nAspect:\n4. Professor Mullen told the court that Costa's confused mental state led to the murder.\n\nThis aspect highlights the crucial role of Luigi Costa's mental state in understanding the murder. Professor Mullen, a mental health expert, testified during the trial that Costa's mental state was confused at the time of the murder. This means that Costa may not have been in full control of his actions or able to make sound decisions. His mental confusion could potentially explain or excuse his behavior to some extent, as it might be considered a mitigating factor in the case. However, without further information about Costa's mental health before and after the murder, it is unclear how much weight this factor will carry in the court's decision.",
        "The jury's verdict, which will determine Costa's guilt or innocence, hinges on demonstrating his mental state at the time of the attack."
