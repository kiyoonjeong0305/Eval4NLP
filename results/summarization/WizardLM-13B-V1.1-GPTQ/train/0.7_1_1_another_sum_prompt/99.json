    "explain": [
        "Chipotle has partnered with the Postmates app to offer delivery services for their online and mobile orders in 67 cities. However, customers should be aware that there will be a 9% service charge added to their bills. Additionally, there may be variable delivery fees applied on top of the service charge. It's worth noting that Chipotle has previously rejected offers of collaboration with third-party delivery services, but has now decided to work with Postmates.",
        "In the given aspect, the emphasis is on the shift in Chipotle's stance towards third-party delivery services. The company had initially rejected such offers, but now they have given Postmates the green light to collaborate and offer delivery for their online and mobile orders. This significant change in approach indicates a willingness to adapt to customer demands and explore new business opportunities.",
        "Chipotle has become so successful that it has attracted political figures like Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio as customers, demonstrating its widespread popularity and strong brand recognition. This not only reflects Chipotle's quality food and customer experience but also contributes to its image as a reputable and influential company within the industry.",
        "The given aspect suggests that other franchises, such as Starbucks, Taco Bell, and Burger King, are also planning to enter the delivery market, which is influenced by Chipotle's decision to start offering delivery through the Postmates app. This demonstrates the growing trend of restaurant chains adopting third-party delivery services to expand their customer base and increase revenue. The increasing competition may also influence Chipotle's decision to collaborate with Postmates. It is worth mentioning that Chipotle was previously hesitant about partnering with third-party delivery services but changed its stance, which may encourage other chains to reconsider their positions as well."
