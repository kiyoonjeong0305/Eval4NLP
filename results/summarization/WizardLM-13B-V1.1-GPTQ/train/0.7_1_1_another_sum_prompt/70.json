        "The core idea of the given aspect is that an FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot.\n\nGive a supporting detail for the aspect.\nThe supporting detail is that the gun was inside a hard rifle case and was secured properly to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites.\n\nCreate a summarized version of the aspect.\nSummarized version: An FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot, despite being secured in a hard rifle case and connected to a truck safe with padlocks and chains.",
        "\nThe core idea of the given aspect is that the FBI agent had followed proper safety protocols by securing the rifle in a hard rifle case and then using a truck safe with padlocks and chains to further protect the weapon from theft. This indicates that the agent was diligent in ensuring the safety of the weapon and the surrounding area. The use of multiple layers of security, such as the rifle case and the truck safe, was intended to deter any potential thieves from attempting to take the rifle. However, despite these measures, the rifle was still stolen from the parking lot of the Marriott Springhill Suites in Salt Lake City.",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that the thief used the momentum from another vehicle to steal the FBI agent's sniper rifle from the hotel parking lot in Salt Lake City. The thief first broke the rear right passenger-side window of the agent's car. Then, they tied a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle, they pulled the rifle case out of the car, stealing the rifle in the process. This method allowed the thief to avoid physically entering the vehicle, making it harder for them to be detected, and also made it easier to steal the expensive rifle.",
        "The aspect mentions that during the March 27 theft, the FBI agent's gear bag, backpack, some clothing, and tools were also stolen. This indicates that the thief not only targeted the FBI agent's sniper rifle but also took additional items that were possibly unrelated to the agent's work. This could suggest that the thief was opportunistic and took anything valuable that was left unattended. It also implies that the thief may have had a means of transportation, such as a vehicle, to carry away these additional items.",
        "The aspect highlights the timing of the theft, suggesting that it occurred just a week before President Obama's planned visit to Utah. This suggests a possible link between the theft and the presidential visit, which could imply that the thief targeted the FBI agent's vehicle specifically due to the high-profile nature of the gun, or was attempting to create a distraction during the president's visit. However, it is important to note that there is no concrete evidence supporting this hypothesis.",
        "The given aspect implies that there were no surveillance cameras present in the hotel parking lot, which could have potentially helped the authorities to identify the thief who stole the FBI agent's sniper rifle from the Salt Lake City hotel.",
        "The given aspect informs us that the Secret Service has been notified about the stolen FBI agent's sniper rifle, but the Secret Service cannot comment on whether the theft prompted an increase of security. This suggests that while the Secret Service is aware of the incident and has likely been informed about the potential security concerns, they cannot disclose whether or not the theft led to any specific increase in security measures around the area. This might be due to security protocols or the ongoing investigation, which may affect their ability to publicly discuss the matter.",
        "The core idea of the aspect \"Police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car\" is that the authorities are uncertain whether the perpetrator intentionally stole the FBI agent's sniper rifle or if it was a random act of opportunity. The police do not have sufficient evidence to determine the motive behind the theft, and it remains unclear whether the thief was aware of the rifle inside the locked case and focused on stealing it, or if they simply targeted the agent's car for other valuables and happened to find the rifle."

    "answer": [
        "Yes, I think the summary contains the core idea. The core idea of the given aspect is that an FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot, and the summary mentions \"An FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot.\"",
        "\nAlthough the summary suggests that the rifle was secured properly to a truck safe with padlocks and chains, it does not provide enough context to determine if this core idea is indeed present in the summary. Upon closer inspection, we can see that the summary merely mentions that the rifle was secured properly to the truck safe and implies that the thief used a rope to steal the rifle from the rear right passenger-side window of the car. While the aspect mentions the security protocols in place, the summary does not explicitly convey the idea that the agent followed proper safety protocols, nor does it specify that the rifle was stolen due to a failure of these measures. Therefore, based on the given summary, it is impossible to conclude whether the core idea of the given aspect is indeed a part of the summary.",
        "\n\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect. While the summary mentions that the thief broke the window, tied a rope around the rifle case, and stole the rifle, it does not explicitly mention the use of another vehicle's momentum to steal the rifle. Instead, it suggests that the thief used a truck safe with padlocks and chains to secure the rifle, which was stolen after breaking the rear right passenger-side window of the car.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect. While the summary discusses the theft of an FBI agent's sniper rifle from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot, it does not mention the theft of the agent's gear bag, backpack, some clothing, and tools.",
        "\n\nI apologize for my earlier response. Upon re-examining the summary, I realize that the aspect mentioned (the theft occurred just a week before President Obama's visit to Utah) is not directly related to the core idea. The summary is focused on describing the theft of an FBI agent's sniper rifle from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot, the security measures taken to protect the rifle, and the method used by the thief to steal the rifle. While the aspect does provide context about the timing of the theft, it does not alter the core idea of the summary.",
        "Yes, the summary contains the core idea. The core idea is the theft of an FBI agent's sniper rifle from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot, and the aspect provided is that surveillance cameras were not available at the hotel. The lack of surveillance cameras may limit the authorities' ability to identify the thief, making the case more challenging to solve.",
        "Based on the given summary, I would not say that the core idea is directly stated. While the summary mentions the theft of the FBI agent's sniper rifle, it does not provide enough information to infer the core idea that the Secret Service was notified about the theft and cannot comment on whether it led to an increase of security. However, this aspect might provide valuable context for understanding the incident's implications and the possible response from the Secret Service.",
        "No, I do not think the summary contains the core idea.\n\nPlease provide any additional information from the summary that supports the idea that the thief may have targeted the agent's car."
