        "To make clear or clear up by giving a detailed account.\n\nIn this context, you will explain the core idea of the given aspect, which is the unexpected rise of 50ft of seabed on Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu.\nSources:\n\nThe article \"Japan Landslide Creates New Stretch of Coastline\" by Hiroko Tabuchi (The New York Times, September 2021) presents the story of a landslide in Rausu, which led to the creation of a new stretch of coastline. The article mentions that the new coastline is 50ft above the original seabed level and came as a surprise to the locals. It explains that the soft ground and altered sea depth due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake tsunami impact may be contributing factors. While the exact cause of the landslide is still uncertain, the event highlights the dynamic nature of coastlines and the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation in coastal communities.",
        "To make clear or comprehensible; clarify\n\nSummary: A landslide in the area of Rausu caused an extra stretch of coastline to rise, and residents are not sure why it's happening 'It's a bit like the tsunami from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake,' said Tanaka. 'The ground is soft and the sea is not quite as deep as before, so we can't say exactly when the landslide happened.' The new stretch of coastline came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the landslide. Moreover, Tanaka has suggested that the landslide might have been caused by the melting of ice and snow in the region. The melting ice and snow have created weaknesses in the ground, making it more susceptible to landslides. Consequently, the locals fear that the new coastline could be unstable and might be prone to further landslides in the future.",
        "To give a clear and comprehensive description of a concept or phenomenon, highlighting its key features, significance, and relevance.\n\nIn this context, the given aspect highlights that an aerial survey has confirmed the landslide as the cause of the newly formed stretch of coastline in Rausu. The researcher who carried out this survey most likely used advanced remote-sensing techniques to analyze the area, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or other aerial photography methods.\n\nThis aspect is important because it provides more certainty about the cause of the coastline change. Previously, there was no indication of the landslide, and locals were surprised by the new stretch of coastline. By using aerial survey techniques, researchers were able to analyze the landscape and coastline more closely, allowing them to identify the landslide as the cause.\n\nIn summary, the core idea of the aspect is that an aerial survey, employing advanced remote-sensing techniques, has confirmed the landslide as the cause of the newly formed stretch of coastline in Rausu. This confirmation provides more certainty about the cause of the coastline change and helps the residents understand the unique situation they face.",
        "In this context, the aspect refers to the landscape change caused by the landslide in Rausu. More specifically, it is about the mass or size of the newly created coastline, which is estimated to be between 1,000-1,640 feet long and 100 feet wide. This information highlights the scale of the landslide event and the subsequent impact it had on the coastline's geography.",
        "To give an account or description of a key point, concept, or detail.\n\nSummary: A landslide in the area of Rausu caused an extra stretch of coastline to rise, and residents are not sure why it's happening. The new stretch of coastline came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the landslide before its appearance. \n\nAspect: Locals heard/felt no indications of movement before appearance.\n\nThe main idea of the aspect is that the local residents did not sense or observe any signs or indications of movement or instability in the area prior to the appearance of the new stretch of coastline caused by the landslide. This suggests that the landslide was unexpected and caught the locals off guard. The lack of any noticeable indicators could imply that the landslide occurred suddenly or gradually developed over time without any significant changes noticeable to the human eye or ear."

    "answer": [
        "Yes, the summary contains the core idea of the given aspect. Although the summary briefly discusses other aspects of the landslide, the core idea of the unexpected rise of 50ft of seabed on Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu is clearly mentioned.",
        "\nAbsolutely, the summary contains the core idea related to the aspect provided. The aspect mentions that the landslide was caused by the melting of ice and snow, which is indeed mentioned in the summary.",
        "Yes, the summary contains the core idea, but it is mentioned in a more general way. The summary mentions that a landslide caused the new stretch of coastline and that it came as a surprise to the locals. It also mentions that the ground is soft and the sea is not as deep as before. All of these details confirm that the landslide is the cause of the newly formed coastline. While the summary does not directly mention the use of aerial survey techniques, it does provide enough information to infer that such techniques were employed to confirm the landslide as the cause. Therefore, the core idea of the aspect is captured in the summary, but its emphasis is more on the details of the landslide rather than the method used to identify it.",
        "\nThe summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect explicitly. However, it does imply the existence of a significant coastline change due to a landslide event. By examining the landslide's location, Rausu, and comparing it to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake tsunami, the reader can infer that the landscape change is significant and unexpected. Moreover, the surprising nature of the event is highlighted by the lack of indication beforehand.",
        "Yes, I apologize for my poor choice of words. Upon re-examining the summary, I can see that the core idea of the aspect is indeed present. Locals did not hear or feel any indications of movement before the appearance of the new stretch of coastline, indicating that the landslide was unexpected and sudden. Thank you for pointing that out."
