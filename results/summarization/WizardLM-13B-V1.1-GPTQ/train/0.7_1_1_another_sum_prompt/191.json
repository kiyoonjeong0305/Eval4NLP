    "explain": [
        "Tevez wants to leave Juventus and move back to his former club Boca Juniors in Argentina.\n\nSupport:\nCarlos Tevez, a striker who currently plays for Serie A champions Juventus, has expressed his desire to leave the club this summer. The 31-year-old wants to return to his former team, Boca Juniors, in Argentina. However, his contract with Juventus does not expire until the end of next season. Before Tevez can leave, he must officially terminate his contract with Juventus. Boca Juniors has confirmed that they are close to completing a deal for Tevez, but only if he first ends his contract with Juventus.",
        "The aspect states that Carlos Tevez has a contract with Juventus that does not expire until 2016. This provides some context to the situation as it suggests that Tevez is under contract with Juventus and has the option to see it out until its conclusion. It also highlights the requirement for Tevez to terminate his existing contract before joining Boca, which could lead to potential complications if Juventus decides to enforce the terms of their agreement.",
        "The aspect indicates that Boca Juniors are at a crucial stage in negotiating and finalizing the transfer of Carlos Tevez from Juventus back to his former club, Boca Juniors, in Argentina. The Argentine club is working diligently to complete the deal and bring Tevez back to his roots. Tevez's return to Boca Juniors would be a significant move for both the team and the player, as he would be able to rejoin the club where he began his professional career and attempt to help them achieve success.",
        "\n\nCarlos Tevez has been instrumental for Juventus, as he has become their top scorer this season despite his reported wish to leave the club. Despite his desire to return to his former club Boca Juniors in Argentina, Tevez has maintained a high level of performance on the field, showcasing his ability to handle challenging situations professionally. His contribution to the team has been essential to their success, making his potential departure a significant loss for the club.",
        "Juventus has started searching for potential players to replace Carlos Tevez, who has expressed his desire to leave the team this summer.\n\nAspect: 5. Juventus have started identifying potential replacements.\n\nSummary: carlos tevez has been told to terminate his contract with juventus to complete a return to his former club boca juniors in argentina. the former manchester city striker's deal with the serie a champions does not expire until the end of next season but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. boca have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for the 31-year-old, but club president daniel angelici has stressed that tevez must terminate his contract with the italians first. juventus have started identifying potential replacements in case tevez leaves the team this summer.",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that Carlos Tevez's potential transfer from Juventus to Boca Juniors will not affect his future with the Argentina national team. Tata Martino, the current manager of the Argentina national team, has expressed that Tevez's move back to Boca Juniors will not influence his selection for the national team. Martino has emphasized that he will consider players based on their current form and performances, rather than their club allegiance. This suggests that Tevez could still feature for Argentina as long as he maintains a high level of play and meets the other selection criteria."

    "answer": [
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea.",
        "Yes, I apologize for my earlier response. Upon re-examining the summary, it seems that the core idea does indeed include the aspect of Tevez having a contract until 2016. The summary mentions that Tevez wants to leave Juventus this summer and join his former club Boca Juniors, but his contract with Juventus does not expire until the end of next season. This creates a conflict between his desire to leave this summer and his contractual obligations to Juventus. Therefore, the summary does indeed contain the core idea of the aspect.",
        "The summary does not contain the core idea that Boca Juniors are close to completing a deal for Tevez. It only briefly mentions Boca Juniors as one of the clubs involved in the potential transfer, but there is no mention of their progress in negotiating or finalizing the deal.",
        "I apologize for any confusion in my previous responses. Upon reevaluating the summary, the core idea does relate to Tevez's performance as Juventus' top scorer. Although the aspect states the same, it is not entirely accurate to say that the core idea of the summary is about Tevez being Juventus' top scorer. The summary revolves around Juventus being informed that Tevez wants to leave this summer, with the club having a contract that extends until the end of next season. Tevez's achievement as the top scorer is mentioned as an additional, but not the prime, focus of the summary. Therefore, the core idea of the summary is not centered on Tevez's scoring, but rather on his reported desire to leave Juventus despite still having a year remaining on his contract.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea. While the summary mentions that Juventus has started identifying potential replacements, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the aspect. The aspect states specifically that Juventus has started identifying potential replacements for Carlos Tevez, which implies that Tevez's departure is imminent. This information is not explicitly stated in the summary.",
        "The summary does not directly contain the core idea of the given aspect. While the aspect mentions Tata Martino's perspective on Tevez's potential transfer and its impact on his Argentina future, it is not the primary focus of the summary. The summary is mostly about Carlos Tevez's desire to terminate his contract with Juventus and complete a return to Boca Juniors."
