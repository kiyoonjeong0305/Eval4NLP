    "explain": [
        "\nThe core idea of the given aspect is that Nigel Pearson, the Leicester City manager, is urging his team to focus on their own performances and not worry about the struggles of their relegation rivals. He has emphasized that Leicester should concentrate on their own matches, maintain composure, and keep their composure in the remaining matches of the season. This approach will help Leicester stay calm and collected, rather than getting distracted by the situation of other teams. By focusing on their own game, Leicester will have a better chance of securing a positive outcome, which could aid their fight against relegation.",
        "This aspect of the summary highlights a vital point concerning the upcoming match between Leicester and Swansea. Leicester, currently just three points outside the relegation zone, have won their past two matches, including an injury-time winner by Jamie Vardy against West Brom on Saturday. With renewed confidence and a opportunity to move further away from the drop zone, they face Swansea at home on Saturday. This match provides Leicester with a chance to continue their revival and secure another crucial victory in their battle against relegation.",
        "The aspect describes how Jamie Vardy's injury-time winner against West Brom has significantly improved Leicester City's chances of survival in the Premier League. The goal not only provided the three points but also gave the team a much-needed confidence boost, as they currently sit just three points above the relegation zone. As a result, the players and the fans are more motivated to push for survival. Vardy's late strike has provided Leicester City with a crucial boost in their fight for survival.",
        "Nigel Pearson is urging Leicester City to stay focused on their own performance and not pay attention to their relegation rivals as they host Swansea City on Saturday in a crucial game in the Barclays Premier League. The Foxes are currently just three points away from safety, and Jamie Vardy's injury-time winner against West Brom on Saturday has given them a timely boost. With ten games left to play in the season, Leicester need to maintain their composure and concentrate on their own performance to have a realistic chance of survival. Pearson believes that losing focus on their immediate goals could be detrimental to the team's chances of staying in the league and is encouraging the players to stay grounded and determined in their bid to maintain their Premier League status."

    "answer": [
        "\nNo, the summary provided does not contain the core idea of the aspect. While the summary briefly mentions Leicester's fight against relegation and their upcoming match against Swansea, it does not highlight Nigel Pearson's explicit emphasis on Leicester focusing on their own performances and not worrying about their relegation rivals. The summary only mentions that Leicester is just three points from safety and Vardy scored a winner against West Brom.",
        "Yes, I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. After reevaluating the summary word by word, I can affirm that the aspect \"Leicester host Swansea on Saturday with a chance of survival after back-to-back wins\" indeed captures the main idea of the summary, where Leicester are focused on avoiding relegation, and their recent victories have boosted their morale ahead of the match against Swansea.",
        "No, I do not think the summary contains the core idea of the aspect. While the summary mentions the importance of staying calm and focusing on their own performance, it does not explicitly emphasize how Jamie Vardy's injury-time winner against West Brom significantly improved Leicester City's chances of survival in the Premier League. As a result, the core idea is not directly touched upon in the summary.",
        "\n\nAfter thoroughly examining the summary word by word, I believe that it does not directly contain the core idea mentioned. The summary focuses on Nigel Pearson's advice to Leicester not to pay attention to their relegation rivals while hosting Swansea, Jamie Vardy's injury-time winner against West Brom, and Leicester's current position in the table. However, it does not expressly mention the idea of Leicester needing to stay focused on their own job to have a realistic chance of survival.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary does not contain the core idea as mentioned in the aspect."
