        "Yes, the summary contains the core idea about the sudden surge in migrant arrivals in Italy, as highlighted by the rescue of 8,480 people in just four days, according to the Italian Coast Guard. This increase has also led to concerns about the missing migrants, such as those mentioned by Save the Children.",

Although the summary primarily focuses on the overall rescue operation and the reported missing migrants, the aspect explicitly states that the Italian Coast Guard was involved in rescuing 145 people from 20 distressed boats on Monday. This information indirectly suggests that some of the missing migrants might have been a part of the 20 boats rescued by the Coast Guard. Therefore, the summary does contain the core idea, albeit indirectly.",
