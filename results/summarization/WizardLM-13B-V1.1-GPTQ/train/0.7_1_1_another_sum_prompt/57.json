    "explain": [
        "Carlos Tevez, a former Manchester City striker, has expressed his wish to terminate his contract with Juventus and leave the club this summer. Tevez has reportedly told the Italian club that he wants to return to his former team, Boca Juniors.",
        "Tevez, despite being the top scorer for Juventus during the current season, has requested to terminate his contract with the club, and Juventus has accepted his departure as he intends to leave this summer. His decision to leave has come as a surprise, given his contributing role to the team's success.",
        "The given aspect implies that Carlos Tevez has expressed his intention to end his career at Boca Juniors, a club he had previously played for. The desire to return to Boca represents a significant emotional connection and personal choice for Tevez, potentially weighing in more heavily than lucrative offers from other clubs. Additionally, it may suggest that Tevez wishes to be closer to his family, as Boca Juniors is based in Argentina, where they initially hail from. This aspect sheds light on Tevez's personal aspirations and possible motivations for leaving Juventus and returning to Boca Juniors.",
        "In light of the given summary, the core idea of the aspect highlights the support from Tevez's international manager for his decision to leave Juventus, irrespective of the club he might join next. Although the manager is not directly mentioned in the summary, the fact that Boca has confirmed they are closing in on a deal for Tevez suggests that he is keen on moving to a new club. The manager's support for Tevez's decision shows a sense of understanding and empathy for the player's personal and professional circumstances.",
        "The given aspect states that for Carlos Tevez to join Boca Juniors from Juventus, he must first terminate his contract with the Italian club, despite it having a validity until 2016. This idea introduces the possibility that there might be limitations or specific requirements for players to leave their clubs before the contract expires.\n\nCore idea: The aspect highlights the need for players to fulfill certain conditions or take specific actions (in this case, terminating their contract) to leave a club before their contract reaches its expiration date. It also suggests that there might be restrictions or limitations on a player's freedom of movement, even when their contract is set to expire."

    "answer": [
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea of the aspect.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea that Tevez is Juventus' top scorer, but the club has accepted his departure. The third sentence of the summary, \"Tevez has shocked Juventus by suggesting he wants to leave,\" indirectly highlights the surprise element of his request to terminate the contract and the club's eventual acceptance of his departure.",
        "\nYes/No\n\nPlease type \"Yes\" or \"No\" to answer the question.",
        "Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Upon inspection, the summary does not appear to contain any mention of Tevez's international manager or their support for his decision to leave Juventus. The aspect provided may not be fully reflected in the summary.",
        "\nUpon a closer inspection of the summary, it does not explicitly state the core idea mentioned in the aspect. Instead, it briefly mentions that Tevez has informed the club of his desire to leave this summer, and Juventus has confirmed they are close to completing a deal with Boca Juniors for the 31-year-old player. The focus of the summary is more on Tevez's intentions to leave Juventus rather than the specific conditions he must fulfill to do so.\n\nTherefore, the given summary does not directly contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect, which is the requirement for Tevez to terminate his contract with Juventus in order to join Boca Juniors. However, it does provide context around Tevez's potential departure from the club."
