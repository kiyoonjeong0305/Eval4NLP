        "\nThe summary suggests that John Peacock has selected a 21-player squad for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Bulgaria, but it does not provide any other essential information about the tournament, such as the team's previous performance or the competition structure. However, based on the aspect, we can infer that England are the defending champions and will be facing tough opponents in Italy, Netherlands, and Republic of Ireland.",
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea. While the summary informs us that John Peacock has named his England squad for the European Under-17 Championship in Bulgaria, the defending champions' backstory, and their opponents in the group stage, it does not explicitly mention that the team is the defending champion. It only states that they are the young lions, which could indicate that they are a new team. Therefore, it's essential to include the aspect mentioned before, which clarifies that the Young Lions are, in fact, defending champions, to avoid any confusion or misinterpretation.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea in a direct manner. While it mentions that England have qualified for the tournament with a 100% record in qualifying, it does not explicitly state that they are placed in Group D alongside Italy, Holland, and the Republic of Ireland. The placed in Group D portion is an implication extracted from the summary, whereas the aspect explicitly mentions the team's group assignment.",
        "\nYes, the summary indeed contains the core idea. The key phrase that indicates this core idea is \"The young Lions are the defending champions, having beaten Holland on penalties in the final last year.\" This statement confirms that England are the current champions and will defend their title in the upcoming European Under-17 Championship. Furthermore, the sentence directly follows the team information and tournament details, making it easy for readers to infer that England's first match will be significant for their title defense. Therefore, the summary effectively conveys the core idea that England's first match is against Italy in Burgas on May 7 as part of their title defense.",
        "\nNot all portraits were painted by men.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea that John Peacock has named his England Under-17 squad for the European Under-17 Championship in Bulgaria next month. The main focus of the summary is on the selection of the squad and their preparation for the upcoming tournament.

Therefore, it is accurate to say that the summary does indeed contain the core idea, even though it does not emphasize it as much as the aspect itself.",
        "No.\n\nWhile the summary briefly mentions that the young Lions are the defending champions, it does not directly state that they are back to defend their title. It only mentions that they will open their campaign against Italy on May 7. Additionally, it does not mention Liverpool duo Herbie Kane and Trent Arnold by name, but it does mention that some players have been recalled after missing the Elite Round of qualifiers last month. The core idea of the given aspect is accurately explained in the explanation, but it may not be directly present in the summary.",
