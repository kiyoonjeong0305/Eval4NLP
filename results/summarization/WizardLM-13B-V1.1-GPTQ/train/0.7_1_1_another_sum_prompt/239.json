        "\nNo",
        "Yes, I believe the summary contains the core idea, although indirectly. The main focus of the summary is on the robbery that occurred at the Christchurch dairy, such as the use of a 'distinctive' cartoon mask, the criminal's motive (the till and an approximate amount of $1500 in cash), and the fact that the perpetrator is still at large.

While the summary mentions the amount of cash stolen (about $1500) and that it was higher than usual, it does not explicitly state that the higher amount was the primary focus of the robbery. Therefore, it is not the core idea of the summary.",
        "After a thorough examination of the summary, it became apparent that the aspect mentioned in the question is not directly stated in the summary. However, the aspect can be inferred from the information provided. The summary does mention that the masked individual robbed a Christchurch dairy and made off with the till and about $1500 in cash, without any weapon being used.
