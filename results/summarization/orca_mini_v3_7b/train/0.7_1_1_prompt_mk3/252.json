        "Orlando City, a MLS team from Florida, seeks Javier Hernandez from Manchester United as it would bring in a significant commercial appeal with the help of their coach, Adrian Heath, known for his playing history at Everton and Manchester City. Hernandez's experience at Real Madrid has been tough, leading to the potential interest from Orlando City.",
        "Orlando City has a significant Latin-American fanbase, which makes them a likely suitable destination for Javier Hernandez, who is from Mexico.

This could potentially work in favor of Hernandez's integration into the team, as he would be coached by someone who shares his profession and has had experience playing at high levels in English football.",
