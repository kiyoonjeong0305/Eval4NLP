        "1. Fiery sunsets in Washington were caused by wildfires in Siberia, which started in southeastern Siberia and later spread throughout the region due to strong winds, destroying dozens of villages.",
        "2. The red and orange hues in the sunsets are a result of smoke particles filtering out shorter wavelength colors, allowing red and orange to penetrate the air unfiltered. The sunset colors are more intense during sunrises and sunsets as there is more atmosphere for light to travel through to reach a person's eye.",
        "3. As the smoke dissipates, air quality will improve, and the fiery sunsets will become less intense."
