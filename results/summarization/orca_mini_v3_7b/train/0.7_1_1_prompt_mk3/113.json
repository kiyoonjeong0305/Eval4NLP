        "1. A North Pacific gray whale named Varvara completed the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded, swimming nearly 14,000 miles.",
        "2. Varvara's journey surpassed a previous record held by a humpback whale, which swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the Arctic and Antarctic regions.",
        "3. Varvara's ability to navigate long distances may indicate that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays, as their numbers are very low."

    "explain": [
        "A North Pacific gray whale named Varvara completed a record-breaking migration of over 14,000 miles, surpassing the previous record held by a humpback whale swimming approximately 10,190 miles.",
        "Varvara, the whale, surpassed a previous record held by a humpback whale for the longest swim, covering around 14,000 miles compared to the humpback whale's 10,190-mile round trip between the Arctic and Antarctic regions.",
        "The mentioned aspect suggests that Varvara's remarkable long-distance swimming might suggest that some Western Gray Whales are actually Eastern Gray Whales, as there are few of them."
