        "Luigi Costa, an elderly man, allegedly committed a brutal killing of his elderly neighbor Terrence Freebody through stomping, throat cutting, and multiple stabbings. The forensic psychiatrist suggests that there was a decline in Costa's state of mind before and during the incident based on the triple-0 calls made by him.",
