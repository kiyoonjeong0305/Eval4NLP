    "explain": [
        "Dr. Adrian Quarterman, a Scottish scientist, proposes that space lasers could potentially be utilized for home heating in the future.",
        "Quarterman's laser can convert sun beams into energy and boost the efficiency of solar panels, opening up possible solutions for power generation in Scotland and fast restoration of power in disaster-hit areas.",
        "Although the laser developed by Dr. Adrian Quarterman has the potential to create renewable energy by converting sunbeams and possibly revolutionizing solar power in Scotland, it cannot be weaponized like movie lasers due to its limited power. Additionally, the concept of control and regulating the system remains a significant concern."
