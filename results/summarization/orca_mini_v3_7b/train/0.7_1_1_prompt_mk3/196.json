        "1. A landslide near Rausu on Hokkaido Island's Shiretoko Peninsula forced 1,000ft of seabed to the surface, exposing the coastline.",

    "explain": [
        "A landslide near Rausu on Hokkaido Island's Shiretoko Peninsula raised a clump of land, which measures roughly 1,000-1,640 ft long and 100ft wide, exposing about 1,000ft of the seabed and the coastline, leading to the emergence of an extra stretch of land. This phenomenon is a result of the landslide, which has raised the mass as high as 50ft from the sea surface.",
        "The emergence of the new stretch of land in Hokkaido, Japan is attributed to a nearby landslide, which has raised the land by 50 feet, providing a new coastline measure to be around 1,000-1,640 feet long and 100 feet wide.",
        "Local residents were unaware of the land movement overnight, implying the event was not witnessed or noticed during their regular routines or observations, suggesting the change was abrupt or sudden."
