        "Babies who took antibiotics during the first six months of life have a higher chance of being overweight as toddlers, according to a large-scale study, with similarities to the effect on farm animals. Around a third of 10-11 year olds in England are overweight or obese.",
        "The study compared the weight, height, and antibiotic prescription records of 12,000 two-year-old children to analyze the potential link between antibiotics usage in infancy and the children's weight and obesity rates.",
        "Children, especially boys, who took antibiotics as infants have a higher risk of obesity, as they are more likely to face issues with weight gain and fattening while growing up."
