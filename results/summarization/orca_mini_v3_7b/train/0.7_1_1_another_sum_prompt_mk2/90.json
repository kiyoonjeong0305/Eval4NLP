        "Scottish scientist Adrian Quarterman proposes that space lasers may eventually be used for heating homes; though it could also be weaponized, it could still potentially revolutionize renewable energy use by making solar power more viable in Scotland and restoring power to disaster-stricken areas.",
        "\n- Dr. Adrian Quarterman's laser research project at Dundee University aims to convert sunbeams into usable energy, which he believes could potentially make solar power a viable option in Scotland. The technology also has the potential to restore power to disaster-stricken areas in a timely manner.",
        "Researchers in Tokyo are suggesting utilizing lasers on the ISS to remove orbiting space debris. They emphasize the lasers would not be strong enough to be weaponized, focusing instead on a non-violent approach to managing space junk."
