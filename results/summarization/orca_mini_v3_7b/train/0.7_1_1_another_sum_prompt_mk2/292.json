        "Luigi Costa, the 71-year-old accused of the 2012 murder, was alleged to have been suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time of the incident, according to forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen.",
        "In 2012, 71-year-old Luigi Costa faces accusations of fatally attacking his elderly neighbour, Terrence Freebody, in Freebody's dining room at his home in Red Hill, Canberra. Costa's alleged actions included stomping on Freebody's head, cutting his throat, and multiple stabbing incidents. The defendant was believed to be suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time of the gruesome 2012 murder, according to forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen, who examined Costa following the attack.",
        "Costa's state of mind prior to and during the attack is crucial for determining his guilt, as the jury might find him not guilty if they can demonstrate that his cognitive impairments significantly impacted his actions at the time."
