    "explain": [
        "Dr. Adrian Quarterman proposes utilizing space lasers for home energy purposes in the future, although he clarifies that the beams in question will not possess the immense power depicted in movies like Star Wars. His research focuses on creating a laser that converts sunlight into energy, ultimately utilizing semi-conductors to distribute the generated power back down to Earth.",
        "Quarterman's solar energy laser project showed promising initial results in Scotland, leading him to consider expanding the testing to Portugal.",
        "Laser technology will be powerful enough to generate energy and used to power homes as suggested by Dr. Adrian Quarterman, but it won't be as intense or advanced as depicted in movies like Star Wars. Dr. Quarterman also recognizes the need for proper control and regulation in practical applications."
