    "explain": [
        "Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu experienced a landslide that generated an extra stretch of coastline rising up to 50ft above sea level. The elevation change is due to melting ice and snow, with the landmass measuring between 1,000 and 1,640 ft long and 100ft wide.",
        "The phenomenon of the raised coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu is likely caused by melting ice and snow, which is responsible for a drop in the land's elevation and the subsequent upwards displacement of the underwater area into the air.",
        "The sudden emergence of the coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu has baffled the local residents as they had no prior knowledge of any tremors or movements before the formation of the landmass."
