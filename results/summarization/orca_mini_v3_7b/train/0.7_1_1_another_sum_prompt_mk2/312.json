        "Luigi Costa, 71, is accused of murdering his elderly neighbor Terence Freebody in 2012. Forensic psychiatrist Paul Mullen believes Costa's state of mind declined leading up to the incident and during the event, with multiple mood fluctuations suggested by triple 0 calls made during the incident. Costa is allegedly dealing with dementia and alcohol abuse.",
        "Forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen points out that according to his analysis, the declining mental state of accused person Luigi Costa was evident during the incident in question. This is supported by the triple 0 calls he made during the event, which indicated inconsistent emotions, and witnessed evidence such as faeces at the crime scene.",
        "The state of Luigi Costa's mind is crucial in determining his guilt; a not guilty verdict is possible if his unstable mental state at the time of the attack can be proven."
