    "explain": [
        "An unprecedented phenomenon occurred in Hokkaido, Japan, when a 1,000-foot seabed was forced to the surface overnight, leading to the emergence of a clump of land that rose 30 to 50ft above sea level. Geologists attribute this event to a massive landslide in the area.",
        "A landslide near Rausu is likely caused by melting ice and snow, which is responsible for the emergence of a clump of land on Hokkaido Island, Japan.",
        "The newly formed clump of land in Hokkaido, Japan, measures 1,000-1,640ft long and 100ft wide, and its coastline has risen up to 50ft from the sea surface. The formation is believed to be a result of a landslide, and there is no further expected expansion."
