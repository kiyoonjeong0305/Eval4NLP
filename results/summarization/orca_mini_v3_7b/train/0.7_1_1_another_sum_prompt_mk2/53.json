    "explain": [
        "ISIS released over 200 Yazidis, a religious minority group, who were killed, captured, and forced to flee last summer when they controlled their towns in Northern Iraq. Most of the released were women and children, with the elderly and ill among them. The freed Yazidis were sent to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil.",
        "The release involved coordination by Arab tribal leaders who then handed over the freed Yazidis to the Peshmerga forces in Irbil.",
        "The aspect suggests that the reason for the release of the Yazidis by ISIS is unclear, though there have been several releases since the attacks last year."
