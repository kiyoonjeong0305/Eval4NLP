    "answer": [
        "It depends on the context and the perspective. In general, the aspect is not mentioned in the summary. However, it could be related to the religious practices of Yazidis, which draw from Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism, or the humanitarian crisis that occurred after the ISIS invasion of Sinjar.",
        "The summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. It merely provides information about the Yazidi religion and its origin, as well as the humanitarian crisis provoked by Isis in Sinjar. The aspect, on the other hand, focuses on the release of Yazidis and the role of Kurdish Peshmerga forces in facilitating their transfer to Irbil.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary only provides general information about the Yazidi people and their religion, and does not mention the ISIS conquest of their towns, the humanitarian crisis that followed, or the reports of massacres and enslavement."
