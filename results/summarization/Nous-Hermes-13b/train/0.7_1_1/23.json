    "explain": [
        "The aspect highlights that Paul Merson initially criticized Andros Townsend's inclusion in the England squad, but later admitted he was wrong after Townsend scored against Italy.",
        "The given aspect highlights the ridiculous behavior of Paul Merson, who mocked Andros Townsend for being brought on in the 7th minute of Tottenham's 0-0 draw with Burnley. The core idea behind this behavior is the tendency of some people to pass judgment on others quickly and without adequate information. In this particular scenario, Merson did not have the full context of the situation and jumped to conclusions about Townsend's substitution without considering the larger picture. He made a jest of Tottenham's decision to bring on their player so late in the game, not realizing that Tottenham were actually trying to secure a draw and that bringing on Townsend was strategic. Thus, the aspect illustrates how people can make fun of others without understanding the full situation or circumstances.",
        "\n\nThe core idea of the aspect is that Andros Townsend and Paul Merson had an ongoing feud, which became more intense after the Tottenham midfielder was brought on with only seven minutes remaining in his team's 0-0 draw with Burnley on Sunday. The aspect also mentioned that Townsend hit back at Merson on Twitter after scoring for England against Italy."

        "I understand that the aspect mentions that Merson and Townsend exchanged Twitter jabs after the game, with the latter hitting back at the former's earlier comments."
