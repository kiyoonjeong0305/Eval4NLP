    "explain": [
        "According to the provided aspect, the release of Yazidis, which consisted mostly of women and children, was carried out by ISIS this week. This news comes as a relief to the refugees who have been displaced and held hostage by the terrorist group for over a year. The aspect also explains that the rest of those freed were either ill or elderly and were received by the Peshmerga forces who then transported them to Irbil for further assistance. It is not yet clear what the motivation behind the release was, but it is a positive development that can potentially pave the way for more rescue operations in the future.",
        "This aspect discusses the release of 228 Yazidis by ISIS this week. The released group includes women, children, and the ill. It is unclear what motivated the release, but they were received by the Peshmerga and sent to Irbil.",
        "\n\nThis week, ISIS released 217 Yazidis, mostly women and children, after airstrikes and rescues. This release is significant because it comes after years of persecution and suffering for the Yazidi community, who have faced cruelty at the hands of ISIS. The group has subjected them to violence and mass killings, targeting them for their religious beliefs. The release of these 217 individuals, most of whom are women and children, is a rare glimmer of hope in a long and difficult struggle for the Yazidi community. It represents progress towards a better future, one where the Yazidis can live in peace and safety."

    "answer": [
        "\nI apologize for the confusion earlier. The aspect does not contain a core idea. It is simply a statement that provides additional information about the release of Yazidis by ISIS. \n\nExplain: According to the summary, the majority of those released by ISIS were women and children, with the rest being either ill or elderly. The freed Yazidis were received by the Peshmerga forces, who then sent them to Irbil for further assistance. It is not yet clear what motivated the release, but it is a positive development that can potentially pave the way for more rescue operations in the future.",
        "It depends on the context in which the term \"core idea\" is used.",
        "It depends on what you mean by \"core idea.\" The summary does not explicitly state the cause of the release, but it does mention that the majority of those released were women and children and that they were received by the Peshmerga and sent to Irbil. The aspect, on the other hand, provides more context about the Yazidi community and their experience with ISIS, which puts the release into a wider historical and cultural context."
