    "explain": [
        "Former Arsenal player Thierry Henry urges his former side to purchase four top players in the summer, including a goalkeeper, center back, defensive midfielder, and striker, in order to improve the team's chances of winning the title.",
        "The core idea of this aspect is that Arsenal's chances of winning the league will be severely impacted if Olivier Giroud remains as their first-choice striker.  Thierry Henry believes that Arsenal need to sign at least four top players in the summer transfer window to compete with the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea. He cites the inadequacy of Giroud's goalscoring record and the need for a more prolific forward to lead the line. According to Henry, the addition of at least one world-class striker will significantly improve Arsenal's chances of winning the title in the upcoming season.",
        "The aspect suggests that Arsenal should invest in buying top players this summer, similar in caliber to those Chelsea signed last season, in order to have a realistic chance of winning the league.\n\nWhat information supports this?\nInformation: The aspect points towards the fact that Arsenal's attack, with Olivier Giroud, is not strong enough to win the league, which is why Thierry Henry urged the club to buy four top players. Additionally, the fact that Chelsea won the league last season with their high-profile signings like Hazard, Costa, and Fabregas makes it imperative for Arsenal to compete in the transfer market."
