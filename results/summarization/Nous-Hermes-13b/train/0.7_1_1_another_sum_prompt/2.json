    "explain": [
        "The aspect discusses the photographs taken by Tim Durkan, a Seattle native, of the fiery sunset in Washington.",
        "The aspect points out that the beautiful sunset that Tim Durkan photographed was not a natural occurrence, but was instead caused by raging wildfires in Siberia.",
        "\nThe aspect states that the wildfires which occurred in Siberia, resulted in destroyed villages and rescue crews putting out the flames.",
        "The aspect states that the lingering smoke from the fires in Siberia carried across the Pacific Ocean and brought a red sunset to the Pacific Northwest. This shows how the effects of the fires were felt thousands of miles away, highlighting their vast scope and impact.",
        "\ncore idea: The aspect states that the sunset was caused by smoke particles filtering out shorter wavelength colors. This means that the smoke particles in the air were able to absorb and scatter the shorter wavelength colors in the light from the sun. As a result, the sky appeared red in color at sunset since red is the longest wavelength color that can pass through the smoked filled air."

The summary mentions that Tim Durkan photographed aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. While this information is interesting, it is not directly related to the aspect about the fires, destroyed villages, and rescue crews. Therefore, the summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect.",
