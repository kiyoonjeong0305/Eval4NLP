        "Ben Stokes has a reputation for being a fiery player and is known for his aggressive behavior in the England cricket team.",
        "Ben Stokes had clashed with West Indies cricketer Marlon Samuels during the second Test of England's tour of the West Indies in April 2015. The incident occurred when Stokes mocked Samuels for continuously leaving the crease while taking guard, as well as for his batting technique. This led to a heated argument between the two players, resulting in the dismissal of Stokes who was subsequently fined 30 percent of his match fee by the ICC for his actions.",

        "One core idea of the given aspect is that England wants to maximize the amount of cricket that they play, in order to give as many of their players as much game time as possible."
