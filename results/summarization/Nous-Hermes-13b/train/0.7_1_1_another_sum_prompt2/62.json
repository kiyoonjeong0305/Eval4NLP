    "explain": [
        "Former England managers have agreed with the call made by FA chairman Greg Dyke to increase the number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12.",
        "The proposed change in the rule defines a home-grown player as someone who trained in England for three years before the age of 18. Instead of limiting it to just playing for an academy team based in England, the new definition broadens the scope of home-grown players to also include those who trained in England for the required duration, regardless of their parents' or guardians' nationality.",

        "The given aspect highlights the concern of prominent English football experts, including Greg Dyke, stating that if the proposal to increase the number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 is blocked, England will fall behind leading football nations and the wait for World Cup victory will only get longer.",

        "The given aspect emphasizes the responsibility of the managers for England's failure to win any honors since 1966, and acknowledges that they bear that responsibility. The managers express humility in their inability to lead the English team to success.",
        "This aspect highlights that while there is support for increasing the number of home-grown players in club squads, there is also recognition of the emergence of a new generation of young players like Harry Kane, which could be considered a positive sign for the future of English football.",
        "The core idea of the aspect is that the proposal by the Football Association (FA) chairman Greg Dyke aims to increase the number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12. This means that clubs will have to include more players who have been trained in their academy or at least developed in the domestic league system, and this change is supported by former England managers such as Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren."
