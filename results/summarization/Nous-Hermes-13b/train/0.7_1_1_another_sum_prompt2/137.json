    "explain": [
        "A core idea of the aspect is that a two-year-old boy at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo fell into a cheetah exhibit after his parents dangled him over the edge.",
        "The aspect states that the boy was rescued by his parents before the firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. This shows that the parents were quick to act and did not wait for emergency services to come to their aid. They took the initiative to rescue their child themselves and get him medical attention.",
        "One core idea of the given aspect is that the boy who fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo suffered minor injuries such as bumps and bruises.",
        "The aspect states that the boy was not attacked by the animals, meaning he did not suffer any physical harm or injury from the cheetahs.",
        "The aspect states that the boy's leg was injured in the fall. This means that there was physical damage to one of his limbs as a result of the slip and fall incident at the zoo. It indicates that the boy sustained some form of harm or damage to his leg that was caused by the fall. The extent of the injury is not specified, but it is clear that the boy was harmed in some way.",
        "Zoo officials believe that one of the reasons the cheetahs did not approach the fallen toddler is because they were frightened by the incident, causing them to retreat.",
        "The zoo intends to press charges against the child's mother under the suspicion of endangering or placing the child in harm's way."
