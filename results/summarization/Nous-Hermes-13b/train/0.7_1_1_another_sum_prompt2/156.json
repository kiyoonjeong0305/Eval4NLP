    "explain": [
        "Ben Stokes, the English cricket player, is known for his aggressive behavior on the field, especially in the England cricket team. His aggression is seen as both a strength and a weakness, as it can lead to great plays but also to trouble with the law, as seen in the incident where he broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed.",
        "Ben Stokes is known for having a fiery character and a strong competitive spirit. This means that he often gets very passionate and animated while playing the game, which can sometimes result in angry outbursts or confrontations with other players. During the second Test between West Indies and England, Stokes got into a heated argument with Marlon Samuels. This incident demonstrates his aggressive nature and his tendency to let his emotions get the best of him.",
        "Ben Stokes displayed a positive response to criticism and negativity by talking to coach Peter Moores, which resulted in his transformation as a better team player.",
        "Stokes got into an intense argument with Johnson during the Ashes series in 2017-18. It all started when Johnson celebrated the wicket of Chris Woakes by rubbing his hands together in front of Stokes' face, which is considered a provocation in cricket. Stokes responded by getting in Johnson's face and saying \"Don't f**king look at me.\" The argument escalated, and both players were involved in a heated exchange before being separated by teammates. This incident highlights Stokes' aggressive on-field behavior and his willingness to stand up for himself.",
        "The core idea of the aspect is that England's coach, Peter Moores, had a long chat with Ben Stokes after the incident with Marlon Samuels during the second test between West Indies and England. This conversation happened because Stokes had forged a reputation for being a fiery character. During the chat, Peter Moores gave him advice that worked, which means that Stokes was able to channel his aggression in the right way after this incident. The advice that Moores gave probably had to do with controlling his emotions and not letting his aggression get the best of him. Thus, this aspect highlights the importance of communication and guidance from coaches in helping players manage their emotions and perform at their best.",

        "The core idea of the given aspect is not found in the summary. Instead, the summary discusses an incident where Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed, and the need to channel his aggression in the right way now that he is back in the England team.",
