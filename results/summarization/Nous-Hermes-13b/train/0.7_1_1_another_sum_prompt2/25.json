    "explain": [
        "This aspect highlights that ISIS released 228 Yazidis, including women and children. Details of this event show the release of Yazidi captives, and the number of people involved.",
        "The given aspect highlights that the release of Yazidi captives from the town of Sinjar was coordinated by Arab tribal leaders. This aspect suggests that the release was not a unilateral decision taken by the Arab tribes, but rather an act of collaboration and cooperation between them. It also implies that the release of the Yazidi captives was a result of their effort to work together for a common goal.",
        "This aspect implies that the reasons behind the abducted Yazidi women being released are not well understood. It raises questions about the motivations of the captors, be it for humanitarian or political reasons, and highlights the murky nature of the situation.",
        "ISIS did not release all Yazidis from Sinjar, including children and elderly, which led to a major humanitarian crisis.",
        "The aspect discusses the religious minority group referred to as the Yazidis. This group is of Kurdish descent and practices a religion that draws elements from Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism. The Yazidis have faced persecution, specifically in relation to the Islamic State's conquest of the town of Sinjar, which provoked a major humanitarian crisis.",
        "The aspect states that ISIS's treatment of Yazidis has been particularly cruel and inhumane compared to other groups they have targeted.",
        "This aspect describes the humanitarian crisis that happened when ISIS overtook the towns of the Yazidi people. During this crisis, the Yazidis experienced great suffering and many of them were forced to flee their homes.",
        "One of the horrific acts committed by ISIS against Yazidi population, in particular, was reportedly raping and enslaving female captives.",
        "The aspect states that an international coalition responded with airdrops and rescues in the face of the humanitarian crisis caused by the conquest of the town of Sinjar by ISIS. \n\nThis means that when ISIS invaded Sinjar, an international group of countries decided to take action and provide aid to those impacted by the attack. They used airdrops to deliver food, water, and other supplies directly to the people who needed it, and also coordinated rescue efforts to help those who were trapped or in danger. Overall, this shows the importance of international cooperation and action in the face of humanitarian crises.",
        "The aspect states that the U.S. and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS as a response to their actions. These airstrikes were meant to prevent further destruction and to protect the people who were affected by ISIS's actions."

It explains that the Yazidi people are of Kurdish descent and their religion is a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism.

This crisis culminated in a great suffering for the Yazidi people and many of them being forced to flee their homes.",
        "The core idea of the aspect is the sexual violence perpetrated against Yazidi women captives by ISIS.",
        "\n\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary provides information about the Yazidi religion and the origins of their beliefs, as well as the humanitarian crisis caused by ISIS's takeover of Sinjar. However, it does not mention the international response to the crisis, which is the focus of the aspect.",
        "I understand, but after examining the summary carefully, it does not appear to contain the core idea of the given aspect.
