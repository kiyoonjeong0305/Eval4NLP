    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that there is a study that found babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be overweight toddlers.",
        "The study linked antibiotic use to weight gain in young children. This aspect suggests that there is a correlation between antibiotic use in infancy and an increased likelihood of being overweight or obese during childhood.",
        "The aspect states that the Finnish study found that boys who were given antibiotics in their first six months of life were more likely to be overweight or obese as toddlers compared to those who were not given antibiotics.",
        "The given aspect suggests that antibiotics may cause weight gain by killing gut bacteria that would normally feed on food. This means that the bacteria in our gut that help in breaking down and extracting nutrients from the food we eat could be affected by antibiotics, leading to an imbalance in the gut flora. As a result, the body may store more fat as a protective mechanism against future gastrointestinal infections. This could lead to an increase in weight over time.",
        "The researchers warn against overprescribing antibiotics in infancy because it may lead to excessive weight gain in children as toddlers.",
        "The study highlights the importance of using antibiotics judiciously in infancy.",
        "The aspect states that the worldwide obesity epidemic is worse for boys and antibiotic use may be an additional contributing factor. This suggests that the use of antibiotics in young boys may be contributing to the rising rate of obesity among this demographic.",
        "According to the study, infants who receive antibiotics are more likely to develop eczema and digestive problems later in their childhood.",
        "The study comes amid growing concern over the overuse of antibiotics.",
        "The statement \"The Government has warned of a new superbug that could infect and kill up to 200,000 Britons\" suggests that British Government is alerting its citizens about the emergence of a dangerous new strain of bacteria that could potentially cause illness and even death to a large number of people."

        "Yes, the summary contains the core idea, which is that babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be overweight toddlers.",

        "The given aspect does not directly relate to the summary. The summary talks about how antibiotics may be fattening our children and the link between antibiotic prescription and overweight or obese 10-11 year olds in England. The aspect, on the other hand, discusses how antibiotics might cause weight gain by killing gut bacteria that would normally feed on food. While both points are related to antibiotics and their possible effects on weight, they are not directly connected.",
