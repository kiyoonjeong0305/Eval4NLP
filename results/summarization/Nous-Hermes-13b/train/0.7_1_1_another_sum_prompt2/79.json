This idea highlights the ongoing relevance and popularity of the story, as it is retold for younger generations who may not be familiar with it.

        "The aspect highlights that A&E, Lifetime, and History will air the remake of the miniseries 'Roots' simultaneously during the simulcast event. The remake will be co-executive produced by LeVar Burton.",
        "The new version of the miniseries \"Roots\" that is being remade by A&E, Lifetime, and History in 2016 will draw from Alex Haley's novel of the same name and consult scholars for added authenticity.",
        "The aspect suggests that the primary goal of remaking \"Roots\" in 2016 is to reach a new generation of viewers by updating the story and its adaptation for contemporary audiences.

    "answer": [
        "Yes, the aspect states that \"Roots\" is being remade for new audiences in 2016. This core idea is present in the summary as well, as it mentions that the miniseries will air in 2016 and that it is a remake of the original.",
        "It seems that the aspect does not fully explain the core idea of the summary. While the aspect mentions the simultaneous airing of the remake by three networks and the involvement of LeVar Burton in its production, it does not necessarily capture the essence of the miniseries or its historical significance.",
        "It depends on what you mean by \"core idea.\" The summary states that the new miniseries is a remake of Alex Haley's novel \"Roots\" and that it will air in 2016. It also mentions that Levar Burton will co-executive produce the new miniseries. The aspect you provided states that the new version will draw from Haley's novel and consult scholars for added authenticity. Therefore, the aspect does not directly conflict with the summary, but it adds important additional information about the production process.",
        "Not really. The aspect mentions that \"Roots\" will air in 2016 and aim to reach a new generation of viewers, but it doesn't explicitly state the core idea of the remaking. The core idea is implied through the mention of the update for contemporary audiences and the involvement of Burton, but it isn't explicitly stated."
