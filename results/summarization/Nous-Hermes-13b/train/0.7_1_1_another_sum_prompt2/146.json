    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that the 13 Yankee Stadium letters failed to find a buyer at a Sotheby's auction on Wednesday.",
        "According to the aspect, Reggie Jackson, the current owner of the signage, wants a new generation to own it. This suggests that he wants to see the signage continue to be enjoyed by fans and appreciators, rather than remain in his ownership. It also implies that he may be interested in passing on the legacy of the signage to someone who will value and appreciate it.",
        "Reggie Jackson bought the 10-feet-tall letters that spelled out \"YANKEE STADIUM\" on a whim or impulse in 2008, without any specific plan or intention to make a profit.",
        "The aspect states that no bids were received for the 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium, which were auctioned at Sotheby's on Wednesday. This means that the letters were not sold at the auction and the current owner, Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, will retain ownership of the signage. The estimated value of the letters was between $300,000 and $600,000, but potential bidders did not express interest in purchasing them.",
        "The aspect provided tells us that Sotheby's auctioned off a Mets bullpen car, which sold for $112,500. This information is relevant to the summary in the sense that it highlights another notable sale of sports memorabilia within the same timeframe as the auction of the Yankee Stadium signage. Both events occurred in 2020, and the sale of the Mets bullpen car adds context to the sale of the signage, which received no bids. It could be interpreted that the market for sports memorabilia may have been saturated or that the high estimate of the Yankee Stadium signage was too high, prompting potential buyers to refrain from bidding."

    "answer": [
        "Yes, the core idea of the aspect is that the 13 Yankee Stadium letters failed to find a buyer at a Sotheby's auction on Wednesday.",
        "I apologize but the summary is too short to represent the core idea of the given aspect. Please provide a longer summary or a more detailed aspect.",
        "Yes, the given aspect does not appear in the summary.",
        "No, the aspect does not contain the core idea of the summary. The summary states that the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction on Wednesday, and the only person who raised a paddle was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump-start the bidding. The aspect, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that no bids were received for the letters, but does not mention the expected value or the unsuccessful bid by the Sotheby's employee.",
        "The summary contains the core idea of the aspect by mentioning that the 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium did not receive any bids at a Sotheby's auction, while a Sotheby's employee attempted to jump-start the bidding. Additionally, reggie jackson currently owns the signage, but it failed to attract any bids during the auction. The aspect, on the other hand, highlights that Sotheby's auctioned off a Mets bullpen car that sold for $112,500. While this information is related to the same timeframe as the auction of the Yankee Stadium signage, it does not directly speak to the core idea of the summary."
