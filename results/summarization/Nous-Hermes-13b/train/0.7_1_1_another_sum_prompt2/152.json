    "explain": [
        "Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, wants to increase the number of homegrown players in top-flight football clubs from 8 to 12, but he is facing opposition from the Premier League.",
        "The core idea of this aspect is that there are former England managers who support Greg Dyke's proposal to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12. They argue that the pool of English talent playing at the top level is shrinking, and therefore, change is necessary to protect the future of the English game.",
        "The aspect highlights that the five former Three Lions bosses have urged support for the FA proposals aimed at improving the development of English talent, amidst opposition from the Premier League.",
        "Another aspect that could contribute to future success of English football is the presence of promising young English players such as Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling, and Harry Kane who are currently making a name for themselves in the premier league. These young players are talented and have the potential to lead the national team to success in international competitions. If they continue to develop and improve, their contributions could play a significant role in the future of English football.",
        "Dyke aims to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to twelve in order to provide more opportunities for English talent."

    "answer": [
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea as it only mentions the proposed increase in the number of homegrown players without any context about the opposition from the Premier League.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of this aspect. \nHow to REALLY understand the core idea.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect.",
        "It is not clear from the summary whether the aspect on promising young English players is directly related to the issue of increasing the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads. Therefore, it cannot be said that the summary contains the core idea. However, it is possible that increasing the number of home-grown players could indirectly benefit the development of young English talent.",
        "This task is about explaining the core idea of the given aspect, which is what Dyke aims to do with regards to increasing homegrown players' opportunities in club squads. The summary does not contain that information, so it is not relevant for this task."
