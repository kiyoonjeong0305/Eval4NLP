    "explain": [
        "\nIn the given aspect, the core idea is that Roberto Martinez, the manager of Everton, had to defend the club's latest penalty fiasco during the match against Burnley.",
        "The aspect states that Roberto Martinez defended another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. It also mentions that Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. However, Martinez insisted that Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. The core idea of this aspect is that Barkley's actions were questioned by some people, including the team's manager, even though he had the right to take the penalty.",
        "This aspect states that Baines would have taken the penalty if Romelu Lukaku was on the pitch. This implies that manager Roberto Martinez had designated Lukaku as the primary penalty taker, and in his absence, Baines would have been the one to take the spot kick.",
        "The aspect highlights the manager Roberto Martinez's defense of Aaron Barkley's decision to take the penalty kick in the match against Burnley. Martinez believes that Barkley had the right to request the duty since it was a part of his job as a player.",
        "Although Roberto Martinez claims that Leighton Baines was unavailable to take the penalty, many people believe that it was a mistake to let Ross Barkley take the spot kick, especially since he had never taken one in a competitive game before.",
        "An essential concept in this aspect is that it mentions an incident that occurred in the match between Everton and Burnley, where Ross Barkley missed a penalty and Roberto Martinez had to defend his decision of allowing Barkley to take the penalty instead of Leighton Baines, who has a better record of scoring penalties. The aspect also highlights that despite this, the match ended in a 1-0 win for Everton, with Kevin Mirallas scoring the winning goal."
