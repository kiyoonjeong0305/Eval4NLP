    "explain": [
        "A core idea of the aspect is that a dress worn by Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind sold for $137,000 at auction. The dress is a significant piece as it was worn by the legendary actress in the iconic film and has been sold for a very high price at auction.",
        "The aspect highlights that apart from the iconic gray dress, more than 150 other items were also sold in the auction. These items belonged to the same movie and were being sold along with the dress. The focus of the auction, however, was on the gray dress due to its significance in the film.",
        "The given aspect states that the dress from the Academy Award-winning film fetched $137,000 at auction. This indicates that the dress, which was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, was highly valued by bidders at the auction.",
        "The dress has been worn for a long time and, as a result, it has deteriorated due to the passing of time and exposure to environmental factors.",
        "The aspect states that a collector bought the dress worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie for $20, however, he went on to collect more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. \n\nWhat is the main idea?\nThe main idea is that a collector who bought the dress was not content with just owning one piece of memorabilia, but eventually amassed a collection of more than 300,000 pieces.",
        "The collector purchased the dress before it was discarded.",
        "The collector's items from the Academy Award-winning film Gone with the Wind, sold at auction by Heritage Auctions, have been used to promote Hollywood, its history and the film itself.",
        "The aspect discusses the top selling items from the auction held by Heritage Auctions, including the jacket and skirt worn by Vivien Leigh in the movie \"Gone with the Wind.\" The aspect mentions that other popular items sold during the auction include a hat worn by Vivien Leigh and a suit worn by Clark Gable. These items, along with the jacket and skirt, were highly sought after by collectors and fans of the film.",

This portrayal highlights the societal dynamics of the time and the changes brought about by the war."

    "answer": [
        "\nNo, I don't think the core idea is present in the summary.",
        "No, the aspect does not contain the core idea of the summary. The summary mentions that the gray jacket and skirt from the famous movie was sold at auction along with more than 150 other items, but the core idea of the summary is that the iconic gray dress was sold in the auction.",
        "In the summary, the core idea is not explicitly stated. However, the information provided about the dress being worn in several key scenes and fetching a high price at auction can be considered as an important aspect.",
        "Only the aspect given to me contains the core idea related to the deterioration of the dress due to its age.",
        "I do not think the summary contains the core idea. The summary simply mentions that the dress was bought for $20 and was later amassed in a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia, without providing information on the collector or the extent of their collection. The aspect, on the other hand, provides more detail on the collector and their collection.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea.",
        "Yes.\n\nGive details to support the aspect.\nThere is no additional information provided, but the summary mentions that the dress, including a jacket and a full skirt, was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie and has suffered some fading to light gray due to age. This aspect of the dress being used to promote Hollywood and Gone With the Wind could be supported by the fact that it is a part of the history of the film and of the industry as a whole. Additionally, the dress could be used to promote the legacy of the film and its cultural significance, as it is a classic example of Old Hollywood glamour and was one of the most successful films ever made at the time. The auction of the collector's items could also be seen as a way to keep the legacy of the film alive and to give fans the opportunity to own a piece of Hollywood history.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea. The aspect elaborates on the top selling items from the auction, including the jacket and skirt worn by Vivien Leigh in \"Gone with the Wind.\" The aspect also mentions that other popular items sold during the auction included a hat worn by Vivien Leigh and a suit worn by Clark Gable. Overall, the aspect highlights the high demand for collectible items from the film.",
        "\nPlease rephrase your answer.",
        "In this case, the aspect does not contain the core idea of the summary. The summary is about an auction of items from the movie \"Gone with the Wind\" and the condition of the dress worn in the movie. The aspect, on the other hand, is about the character of Scarlett O'Hara in the book and movie. While both the summary and the aspect are related to the movie \"Gone with the Wind,\" they are not directly related to each other."
