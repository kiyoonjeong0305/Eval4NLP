    "explain": [
        "A core idea of this aspect is that ISIS released 228 Yazidis, including women and children, after overtaking their towns in northern Iraq last summer.",
        "The aspect states that Arab tribal leaders played a significant role in coordinating the release of Yazidis who were held captive by ISIS.",
        "The aspect \n- Describes the action taken by the Peshmerga once they were informed about the release of a group of captives.\n- The Peshmerga received the freed Yazidis in the area and sent them to safety in Irbil, where they were able to find refuge and care.\n- This shows the determination of the Peshmerga to help and protect the Yazidis, as well as their dedication to ensuring their safety and wellbeing.",
        "The aspect states that ISIS previously released other Yazidis, mainly children and the elderly, as part of its strategy to win the trust of the international community.",
        "The Yazidis are an ancient religious community that has suffered persecution and cruelty from ISIS. The aspect describes the Yazidi community and its history of suffering at the hands of ISIS. This core idea highlights the importance of understanding the religious and cultural context of the Yazidi community when discussing their plight under ISIS. It also emphasizes the ongoing need for advocacy and support for Yazidis who have been affected by the conflict.",
        "One of the core ideas of the aspect is that during the conflict with ISIS, reports emerged of the extremist group slaughtering and enslaving Yazidi women.",
        "The given aspect highlights the role of international coalition and airstrikes in the ongoing crisis involving the rescue of Yazidi captives by ISIS. This indicates that there is an organized effort being undertaken by multiple countries to address the issue through military intervention.",
        "Yazidis are a small religious minority in Iraq, making up less than 1% of the country's population. This means that their population is very limited and they are a distinct minority in Iraq."

    "answer": [
        "After considering the given summary and aspect, I don't believe the summary contains the core idea. The summary refers to the release of 228 Yazidis by ISIS, including women and children, while the aspect provides additional information about the specific number of people released and the time frame when this occurred.",
        "\nNo! The summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect. Instead, it provides information about the group of people who were released by ISIS.",
        "The answer lies in your ability to read and interpret the given text, and to identify the core idea mentioned in the aspect.",
        "based on the given summary, it is possible that the aspect could be inferred, but it is not explicitly stated.",
        "No. The summary contains an unrelated piece of information about the release of some Yazidi captives, but it does not explain the core idea of the aspect about the history and persecution of the Yazidi community.",
        "Actually, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The core idea of the aspect is regarding the treatment of Yazidi women by ISIS, while the summary is about the release of some captives by ISIS.",
        "based on the given aspect, it seems that the summary does not contain the core idea. The summary only provides information about the released Yazidi captives, mainly women and children, and does not mention any international efforts or military intervention in response to the crisis.",
        "Yes, the aspect that \"Yazidis make up less than 1% of Iraq's population\" is closely related to the summary as it gives more information about the minority group to whom the summary is referring."
