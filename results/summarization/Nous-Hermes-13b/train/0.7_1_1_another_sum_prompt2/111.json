    "explain": [
        "Leicester are currently just three points away from being safe from relegation in the Barclays Premier League.",
        "Nigel Pearson is urging his side to remain focused on their performance and not get distracted by their relegation rivals. He wants them to stay calm and composed during this challenging period.",
        "Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs and not worry about what other teams are doing.",
        "The aspect states that the Foxes (Leicester City) will be hosting Swansea on Saturday in the Barclays Premier League.",
        "Vardy's injury-time winner against West Brom was crucial in helping Leicester City secure a much-needed 3-2 victory and move them closer to safety in the Premier League. The goal not only gave Leicester the win but also provided a huge boost of confidence for the team to keep pushing for survival. The goal was also significant because it showed the team's determination and never-give-up attitude, which is essential in their fight against relegation. Overall, Vardy's injury-time winner was a pivotal moment in Leicester City's battle for Premier League survival.",
        "Nigel Pearson, the manager of Leicester, has urged his players to focus on their own performances and ignore the efforts of their relegation rivals. He believes that as long as they continue to play to the best of their abilities and pick up points in their remaining games, they will remain in control of their own fate and be able to stay in the Premier League.",
        "According to Pearson, people may try to shift the focus from playing well and achieving results to just avoiding relegation. However, he believes that his team should keep their cool and stay focused on playing well while maintaining a positive attitude.",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that Leicester needs to focus on their own performance and not worry about the other teams in the relegation zone. They need to make sure that their own run-in in the remaining games is what they want it to be and not be affected by the wins or losses of the other teams. By focusing on their own performance, they can increase their chances of staying in the Premier League.",
        "The aspect highlights that other teams are also being dragged into the relegation battle alongside Leicester City. This is helpful because it can take the pressure off of the Foxes and relieve some of the pressure to perform consistently in order to avoid relegation. By not being the only team facing the threat of relegation, Leicester may be able to focus on their own performance without feeling as though they are on their own in the fight for survival. Additionally, it may provide an opportunity for other teams to help Leicester by potentially dropping points against them or other teams in the relegation zone. This would increase the likelihood of Leicester being able to stay up in the league.",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that while results going Leicester's way can provide hope in their fight against relegation, it is ultimately up to Leicester to take care of their own business and not rely on others' results. They need to focus on performing well and getting the necessary points to stay in the Premier League, regardless of what happens with the teams around them.",
        "Leicester needs to stay in touch with the clubs near them in the relegation zone. By doing this, they can have control over their own fate and avoid being cut adrift from safety. It's important for the team to keep winning games and closing the gap on the teams above them.",
        "One of the core ideas of this aspect revolves around the attitude and mindset of people. This idea suggests that people sometimes become overly optimistic and overconfident, often believing that everything will work out in their favor, no matter what they do. This overconfidence can lead to a sense of complacency or a lack of caution, ultimately resulting in negative outcomes."

        "The core idea of the given aspect is that Leicester City will be hosting Swansea City in a Barclays Premier League match on Saturday, April 11, 2020.",
        "The summary suggests that Pearson has urged Leicester to keep their cool and ignore their relegation rivals while hosting Swansea on Saturday, just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League, after winning two consecutive matches. \nThe aspect states that Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Brom, which turned out to be crucial in helping Leicester secure a much-needed 3-2 victory, moving them closer to safety in the process. \nWhile the summary doesn't explicitly mention the injury-time goal, it does highlight the importance of the game against West Brom, and how the victory brought Leicester closer to survival in the Premier League. Therefore, the core idea of the aspect is present in the summary albeit indirectly.",
        "\nDoes the summary contain the core idea of the aspect? \nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The aspect states that Leicester's future is in their own hands, which means that they have the power to determine their own fate by winning games and accumulating points. The summary does not mention anything about Leicester being in control of their own fate or the importance of their own performances.",
        "The core idea is not directly stated in the summary, but it can be inferred from the information provided.",
        "The summary does not contain any clear indication of the core idea of the aspect.

The aspect about focusing on their own run-in is not mentioned in the summary.",
        "\nI understand that the aspect is helpful but I don't understand why that is the core idea of this aspect. Could you please explain it to me?",
        "After analyzing the summary, I don't believe that the core idea of the given aspect is contained within it. The summary is focused on Nigel Pearson's message to the team and the upcoming match against Swansea City, rather than the idea of relying on others' results or focusing on their own performance.",
        "The given aspect is not directly related to the summary. However, it is an important idea to consider since Leicester is in a relegation battle. Staying in touch with the teams near them is important for their survival.",
        "It depends on the context in which it is being used. If the aspect is being used to provide a warning against the dangers of overconfidence, then it is possible that the summary could contain a core idea related to this aspect. However, if the aspect is being used to discuss something completely unrelated to the summary, then it is unlikely that the summary would contain a core idea related to the aspect."
