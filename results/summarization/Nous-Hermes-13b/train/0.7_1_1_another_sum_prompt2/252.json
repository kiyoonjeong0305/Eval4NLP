    "explain": [
        "Orlando City FC are interested in signing Javier Hernandez, who is on loan at Real Madrid, due to his potential to attract commercial revenue to the Florida-based franchise.",
        "Orlando City, being a professional soccer team based in Florida, has a predominantly Latin-American fanbase. Kaka, a Brazilian soccer player, is their team captain and represents the Latin flavor of the team. \n\nHow does this information relate to the summary?\nIt states that Orlando City has a Latin-American fanbase, which makes Javier Hernandez, a Mexican soccer player, a potential commercial draw for the franchise. Additionally, having Kaka as their captain symbolizes the team's connection to the Latin-American community and adds value to Hernandez's potential transfer.",
        "The aspect mentions that eight European sides are also interested in Hernandez, which indicates that the Mexican footballer is not only attracting interest from MLS side Orlando City, but also from top clubs in Europe.",
        "This aspect implies that besides Orlando City, Southampton, Stoke, West Ham, and Everton are also interested in acquiring Javier Hernandez's services from Manchester United.",
        "The given aspect states that Manchester United is willing to sell Javier Hernandez for around £8 million. This suggests that the English club is open to the idea of parting ways with the Mexican striker, who has had a tough time on loan at Real Madrid. The sale of Hernandez would fetch United a decent transfer fee, which might help them with their transfer budget for the upcoming window.",
        "\nAfter the impressive performance of Andreas Pereira while on loan at Valencia last season, Manchester United decides to renew its contract offer to the player, in order to retain his services.",
        "The aspect states that four well-known European clubs - Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord - are interested in Portuguese midfielder André Pereira, who plays for Boavista. It is implied that these clubs are competing to sign him.",
        "The given aspect states that Dillon Pereira rejected Manchester United's first contract offer. This means that the football player did not accept the initial proposal put forth by his current club, Manchester United. Instead, he chose to hold out for a better deal. This may indicate that Pereira is looking for an improved contract in terms of salary or other benefits, or perhaps he wants assurances of more playing time. Whatever the reason, it appears that Pereira and his representatives are not satisfied with the initial offer from Manchester United, and they are willing to negotiate for a better deal."

    "answer": [
        "The aspect describes the interest that Orlando City FC has expressed in signing Javier Hernandez, who is on loan at Real Madrid, in order to increase their commercial revenue.",
        "The aspect does not seem to be related to the summary in any way. The summary is about Orlando City's interest in Javier Hernandez, while the aspect talks about the team's Latin-American fanbase and Kaka as their captain.",
        "Yes, the core idea of the aspect is that Hernandez is not only attracting interest from Orlando City in the MLS but also from eight European sides.",
        "No, the aspect does not appear to be present in the summary.",
        "It depends on the context in which the aspect is mentioned. If the aspect is mentioned in a section of the summary that discusses United's willingness to sell Hernandez, then yes, the aspect is core to the summary. If the aspect is mentioned in a section of the summary that discusses Orlando City's interest in Hernandez, then the aspect is not core to the summary.",
