        "ISIS released 228 Yazidis who were mainly women and children, with the help of Arab tribal leaders. The core idea of this aspect is that the Yazidis who were captured by ISIS were released with the assistance of Arab tribal leaders. The release of these Yazidis is a positive development, and it is notable that Arab tribal leaders were instrumental in facilitating their release and ensuring their safe transfer to the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.",

This shows that the cooperation between different groups in the region played a crucial role in securing the release of the Yazidis held captive by ISIS.",
