    "explain": [
        "The core idea of this aspect is that a woman who had suffered seven miscarriages had set aside £207 for a £500 grave stone for her baby's burial but her friend Jamie stole it.",
        "Dawn had suspected Jamie of stealing her money and alleged him to be a thief on the show. A lie detector test was conducted which proved her claim and showed that he was not being truthful about his actions. Consequently, this emotional moment of Dawn realizing the betrayal of her house-mate made headlines as an impactful scene.",
        "The given aspect highlights Dawn's emotional state after finding out that Jamie was lying about the theft of her belongings. According to the text, she was left \"furious and devastated\" by the revelation which suggests that she felt very upset and disappointed by Jamie's dishonesty."

    "answer": [
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary states that the woman who appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show had accused her house-mate Jamie of stealing from her and a lie detector test revealed that he was lying, which led her to burst into tears. It also mentions that she had set aside £207 for a £500 grave stone for her baby's burial, but Jamie stole it.",
        "I disagree. The summary does not explicitly state that Dawn accused Jamie of stealing the money on the show and was proven right by a lie detector test. The aspect provides more clarity on the situation and the core idea is not present in the summary.",
        "I have already explained the core idea of the given aspect. The summary does not seem to contain any information about Dawn's emotional state after the lie detector test."
