        "The aspect provides information about a four-year-old boy named James Hayward who had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport.",
        "James' harmless toy was deemed security risk by the \"over-zealous\" security officers, which led to them demanding that he hand it over.",

        "The aspect states that the family bought James a new toy gun after returning from their holiday in Lanzarote.
