    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that an FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot.",
        "The aspect highlights that the rifle was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains. This suggests that the FBI took precautions to ensure the safety and security of the rifle. Despite these measures, the rifle was stolen, indicating that the thief may have had specialized knowledge or tools to bypass the security measures in place.",
        "The core idea of the aspect is that the thief stole an FBI agent's rifle from a Salt Lake City hotel by breaking the rear right window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle, and using the momentum from another vehicle to break the case's handle free from the lock.",
        "\nThe aspect states that in addition to the sniper rifle, other items belonging to the FBI agent were also stolen from his car. These items include his gear bag, backpack, some clothing, and tools. It seems that the thief was not only after the high-powered weapon, but also took other items that the agent may have needed while on duty. This could imply that the theft was planned and the thief had knowledge of what he was targeting.",
        "One of the aspects mentioned is that the theft happened just a week before President Obama's visit to Utah. The timing of the theft is significant as it raises concerns about security before the president's arrival. This aspect highlights the potential dangers that such thefts poses to high profile events and personal safety.",
        "Without surveillance cameras, it is difficult for the authorities to identify the person or persons responsible for stealing the FBI agent's sniper rifle from his car at the hotel.",
        "The given aspect states that the Secret Service was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit to Utah, indicating that the Secret Service was aware of the situation and took necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the President during his visit.",
        "This aspect implies that police do not have any evidence to suggest that the thief had any prior knowledge about the presence of FBI agent's sniper rifle in his car and targeted it intentionally. The thief could have stolen the rifle as a result of a random break-in or by trying his luck with several parked cars before he found a rifle worth stealing.",
        "The core idea of this aspect is that the FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites sometime overnight.",
        "The aspect highlights the proximity of the hotel to the FBI office in Salt Lake City. This makes it likely that the theft was pre-planned and the thief knew about the presence of the FBI agent's sniper rifle in the hotel. The close proximity of the hotel to the FBI office also implies that the agency's response to the theft was quick and efficient, given their proximity to the scene of the crime. This is a key detail that likely contributed to the successful recovery of the stolen weapon."

    "answer": [
        "No, the core idea of the aspect is not present in the summary.",
        "It depends on what you consider the \"core idea\" to be. If the \"core idea\" is that the rifle was stolen, then yes, the summary contains that information. However, if the \"core idea\" is that the FBI took precautions to secure the rifle but it was still stolen, then that information is not explicitly stated in the summary.",
        "Do you REALLY think the summary contains the core idea? No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary only mentions that the gun was stolen and was secured to a truck safe, but it does not provide any details about how the thief broke the window and stole the rifle.",
        "Based on the aspect given, it is not clear if the summary contains the core idea. The summary only mentions the theft of the sniper rifle and does not mention any other items being stolen from the agent's car.",
        "Incorrect. The aspect mentioned is not present in the summary.",
        "Yes, the given aspect is mentioned in the summary. It states that police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right window of the FBI agent's car, and also that the car did not have surveillance cameras.",
        "I think the given aspect is relevant to the summary as it highlights the precautions taken by the Secret Service to ensure the safety of the President during his visit.",
        "It depends on the interpretation of the core idea. If the core idea of the aspect is \"unintentional targeting\" then the summary does not explicitly state that, however, it does imply it when it says that the thief stole the rifle after breaking the rear right window, suggesting it was a random break-in. So, the summary can be seen to contain an implicit expression of the core idea.",
        "While both summaries contain information related to the same event, the core idea of the aspect mentioned is not present in the summary.",
        "The aspect does not directly relate to the summary provided. It is an additional piece of information about the location of the hotel in relation to the FBI office in Salt Lake City. While it may be interesting, it does not help to explain the core idea or message of the summary."
