    "explain": [
        "One of the core ideas of the aspect is that Leicester, as a team, should focus on their own job and performance rather than worrying about the situation of their relegation rivals. Nigel Pearson, the manager of Leicester, emphasizes that his team should stay calm, focused, and determined in their upcoming match against Swansea on Saturday. He believes that Leicester is capable of staying in the league if they can maintain their composure and continue to perform as a team. By concentrating on their own game rather than worrying about the struggles of other teams, Leicester can potentially pull ahead and move up the table. In other words, the team needs to stop looking behind them and instead look forward and upward towards safety.",
        "Nigel Pearson, the manager of Leicester City football club has urged his team to remain calm and focused, even as they are embroiled in a relegation battle in the English Premier League. He has also urged them to not be distracted by the antics of their rivals. In particular, Leicester City are currently three points away from safety in the league table and they will be hosting Swansea City on Saturday in their pursuit of survival. Jamie Vardy, the team's striker, scored a crucial injury-time goal against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, which helped them to gain valuable points in their fight against relegation. Therefore, Nigel Pearson is advocating a mentality of hope and determination amongst his players to turn their fortunes around.",
        "\nOne of the core ideas conveyed by this aspect is that Nigel Pearson is encouraging his team not to get too caught up in the results of other teams in the league, especially their relegation rivals. He wants Leicester to focus solely on their own performance and not let the pressure of trying to avoid relegation affect their play. By keeping their cool and playing their game, Leicester have a better chance of securing the three points and moving further away from the bottom of the table."

    "answer": [
        "I apologize for any confusion earlier. However, the aspect provided does not seem to contain a core idea that can be explained. Instead, it is merely a statement about the aspect of focusing on their own job and ignoring relegation rivals, which is already covered in the summary. Therefore, there is no need for further explanation of the aspect in this case.",
        "This task is too difficult for me to determine if the core idea of the aspect is present in the summary or not. Can you please provide the summary once again for me to analyze?",
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea mentioned in the aspect. While it does mention that Leicester are just three points from safety and that Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Brom, it does not specifically mention Nigel Pearson's advice to the team to keep cool and not get carried away with other teams' results."
