    "explain": [
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that a woman had seven miscarriages and saved up money for a grave stone for one of her babies that she lost.",
        "The aspect states that the bereaved mother, named Dawn, suspected her friend Jamie and his girlfriend Carol of stealing the money from her home. However, she didn't have any evidence to prove her suspicion.",
        "The aspect states that Dawn asked Jeremy Kyle to conduct a lie detector test, which showed that Jamie had taken the money. This means that Dawn suspected Jamie of stealing her money and so requested a lie detector test to determine if he was telling the truth. In the end, the test proved that Jamie had taken the money, which led to Dawn's confrontation and subsequent departure from the show.",
        "\nThe aspect states that Jamie initially blamed his girlfriend Carol but later confessed his love for Dawn, the grieving mother, in a Facebook message. The idea conveyed is that Jamie was not honest with his initial accusations and instead chose to shift the blame. He later expressed his true feelings for Dawn, which could indicate a deeper motive for his actions.",
        "Dawn's child had passed away and she was left devastated by the event, having to say goodbye to her baby with a headstone. This demonstrates the emotional toll that the loss of a child can have on someone."

        "The summary does not explicitly state that Dawn asked for a lie detector test, so it does not contain the core idea that is mentioned in the aspect.",
        "I think the summary is not sufficient to contain the core idea of the aspect and more information would be required to understand the relationship between the two.",
        "No, the given aspect is not present in the summary."
