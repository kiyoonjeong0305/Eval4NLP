    "explain": [
        "This aspect states that Ben Stokes has a reputation of being fiery and naturally aggressive in the England cricket team. It highlights that his passion for the game often leads to him getting emotionally invested in his performances, which can sometimes result in explosive behavior. This core idea suggests that while Stokes' temper might sometimes get the better of him, it is also a reflection of his deep commitment to the game.",
        "The given aspect suggests that the team values Ben Stokes's skills such as scoring runs and taking wickets, but only if his aggression is controlled. Therefore, while his physical aggression like punching a locker after being dismissed or clashing with an opponent might not be encouraged, his competitive spirit and aggression on the field as a cricket player are appreciated as long as they are within the limitations of acceptable behavior.",
        "The core idea of the given aspect is that England wants to play both Ben Stokes and Chris Jordan in as many matches as possible in order to help them reach their full potential as cricket players. \nSupport: The reason behind this desire to play them often is due to the belief that both Stokes and Jordan have a great deal of talent and could significantly enhance the team's performance if they are properly utilized. By giving them ample opportunities to play, the team could help them gain experience and confidence, resulting in improved overall performance.",
        "\n\nThe aspect states that there might be a debate on playing a second spinner in Adil Rashid if Stokes or Jordan are selected in the team. This means that if Ben Stokes or Craig Overton (Jordan) are chosen for the team, there could be controversy about whether or not to include another spin bowler, such as Adil Rashid, in the line-up. Some people might argue that having two spinners would be an advantage, while others might say that it could weaken the team by leaving no part-time spin option and reducing the number of seamers. The decision ultimately depends on the captain and coach, who must weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages of each option."

    "answer": [
        "The summary does not explicitly mention the core idea of the aspect. It does, however, provide context about Stokes' behavior and interactions with other players, which could be seen as related to his fiery nature. The aspect itself provides more direct information about Stokes' reputation for being aggressive and passionate, which is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.",
        "It depends on how you interpret the summary and the aspect. If you think the summary is about Ben Stokes's temperamental behavior, then the aspect is about controlling his aggression. However, if you interpret the summary as highlighting Stokes's skills and aggression, then the aspect is about controlling his physical outbursts while still valuing his competitive spirit.",
        "I am sorry, but I do not understand the question. Can you please rephrase it?",
        "Yes, the core idea of the aspect is present in the summary. The conflict between Stokes and Samuels, as well as Stokes' injury, are both mentioned as context for the discussion of whether or not to include a second spinner in the team. The summary does not explicitly mention Adil Rashid or debate over playing two spinners, but it does provide background information on the potential selection of Stokes and Jordan, which makes the aspect relevant."
