    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that an FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot. The thief likely broke the rear right passenger-side window, tied a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and stole the gun from the hard rifle case inside the truck safe secured by padlocks and chains.",
        "The aspect highlights that the gun was inside a hard rifle case and was secured properly to a truck safe with padlocks and chains. This implies that the FBI agent took appropriate measures to store and protect his weapon, which shows diligence and responsibility.",
        "The aspect states that the thief broke the car's window and used a rope or cable lock to pull the rifle case out of the window.",
        "The given aspect highlights that the thief not only stole the FBI agent's sniper rifle, but also some additional items that were present inside the car. These included the gear bag, backpack, clothing, and tools. It suggests that the thief likely took a larger haul than just the rifle.",
        "The given aspect points out that the theft of an FBI agent's sniper rifle occurred just a week before President Obama's visit to Utah. This suggests that there might be a possibility that the theft was politically motivated or an attempt to undermine the President's security during his visit. It is not mentioned in the summary if any other valuable items were stolen from the car or if this was a targeted theft. It also remains uncertain if the theft is connected to the President's visit in any way or if it was a random act of crime.",
        "The aspect states that the stolen sniper rifle, which was an FBI agent's weapon, has not been recovered yet.",
        "The given aspect highlights that the hotel where the FBI agent's sniper rifle was parked does not have surveillance cameras. This means that there are no cameras installed in the premises that could have captured images of the incident or helped the police in identifying the thief. As a result, the investigation has become challenging for the police and it is difficult to determine how the theft occurred or who was behind it.",
        "According to the aspect, the Secret Service was informed about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit to Salt Lake City. This suggests that they took necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the President during his visit. The fact that the Secret Service was informed indicates the seriousness of the situation and the need for heightened security measures. The aspect provides insight into the level of preparedness and caution that was taken by the Secret Service to ensure the President's safety during his visit to Salt Lake City.",
        "The core idea of this aspect is that the police are not sure whether the person who stole the sniper rifle from the FBI agent's car specifically targeted that particular vehicle or if they just happened to come across it and decided to steal it.",
        "The given aspect states that the theft happened overnight from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying. This means that theft occurred during the night while the FBI agent was staying in the hotel."

    "answer": [
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea. The core idea of the given aspect is that an FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot. The thief likely broke the rear right passenger-side window, tied a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and stole the gun from the hard rifle case inside the truck safe secured by padlocks and chains.",
        "Of course I do! The summary states that the FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot while it was secured to a truck safe and locked with padlocks and chains. This aspect of the summary highlights the precautions taken by the agent to protect his weapon, indicating his professionalism and diligence.",
        "I don't think so. The summary only mentions that the gun was stolen from the truck safe and does not mention how the thief stole the rifle.",
        "I understand that the summary contains information about a sniper rifle being stolen from a car in a hotel parking lot in Salt Lake City. However, I do not see anything that suggests the core idea of the given aspect, which is that the thief stole additional items besides the rifle.",
        "The summary does not contain any information about the President's visit or any political motivation behind the theft. Therefore, the aspect mentioned is not a core idea of the summary.",
        "Yes/No?",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea. The aspect states that the hotel does not have surveillance cameras, which implies that there was no visual evidence collected by the cameras that could have been used to identify the thief. This raises the question of how the police plan to identify the culprit and why the camera system was not in place in the first place.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect. The aspect provides additional information about the security measures taken by the Secret Service in response to the stolen rifle, while the summary only discusses the theft of the rifle.",
        "It's not relevant to the aspect.",
        "Not entirely. While the given aspect provides additional context, such as when the theft occurred, it is not directly related to the core idea of the summary, which is about a sniper rifle being stolen from a car parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites hotel."
