    "answer": [
        "No, the given aspect does not contain the core idea of the summary. The summary discusses the theft of a brand new 2015 Ford Fusion from the driveway of a woman named Becky Schoenig of St. Louis, Missouri, just over a month after she took delivery of the car. It was later retrieved by the police with modifications. However, the aspect only talks about the modification to the car, and not its theft and retrieval.",
        "I am not convinced that the summary accurately represents the core idea of the aspect. The aspect suggests that the car thieves made physical modifications to the car before attempting to return it, but the summary does not mention this. It simply states that the car was stolen and found again, with no mention of any modifications.",
        "I'm not sure what you mean. Could you please clarify?",
        "After inspecting the summary carefully, I can confidently say that the aspect does not contain a core idea that is directly related to the main topic of the summary."
