    ],
    "explain": [
        "The core idea of the aspect is that an FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot.",
        "Despite being secured properly, the gun was still stolen from the truck. This demonstrates that no level of security is foolproof and that even the most careful measures can be bypassed by determined thieves. It highlights the importance of being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to law enforcement as soon as possible.",
        "Police believe the thief used a rope and vehicle to break the case's handle free.",
        "The aspect highlights that besides the rifle, there were several other items that were stolen from the FBI agent's vehicle, including a gear bag, backpack, clothing, and tools. These items likely had some value and were important to the agent in their line of work.",
        "The aspect suggests that the timing of the theft may have been related to President Obama's visit to Utah, which was scheduled a week later. It could have been an attempt to disrupt the president's visit or to make a political statement. Alternatively, it may have been coincidental and unrelated to the president's visit.",
        "The aspect highlights that the stolen sniper rifle has not been recovered by authorities, and the agent's bags containing other items were found at a nearby hotel. This shows that the thief was able to successfully remove the rifle from the secure case and may still have access to the other stolen items.",
        "The aspect suggests that it is uncertain whether the thief specifically targeted the agent's car or if it was a random act. The thief could have been opportunistic and targeted the first car they came across with the gun case or it could have been a deliberate act aimed at the agent. It is also possible that the thief did not know what was inside the case but took it anyway.",
        "The Secret Service could not comment on any increased security measures due to the ongoing investigation and to protect the integrity of future investigations."

        "\n\nRephrase the core idea in your own words.\nThe primary thought of the aspect is that a sniper rifle belonging to an FBI agent was taken from a car park area in Salt Lake City hotel.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The aspect describes how the gun was secured properly but still stolen, while the summary is focused on the methods used by the thief to steal the gun.",

        "No, the aspect does not share any core idea with the summary. The summary is focused on the details of the theft and the security measures taken, while the aspect is related to the timing of the theft in relation to President Obama's visit to Utah.",
        "Only if the core idea is related to the fact that the stolen sniper rifle has not been recovered.",
        "The summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect mentioned. The aspect is about the motive or intent behind the theft, while the summary is about the method used to steal the gun and other items.",
        "It depends on the context in which the summary is used. If it is used to provide information about the theft of a gun and related items, then the core idea of the aspect may not be directly mentioned in the summary. However, if the summary is used to convey information about the Secret Service's response to the theft, then the core idea of the aspect may be indirectly present in the summary."
