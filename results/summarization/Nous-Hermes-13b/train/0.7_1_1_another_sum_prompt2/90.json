    "explain": [
        "Dr Adrian Quarterman is working on a space laser that could potentially be used to heat homes in the future.",
        "The aspect states that the laser will convert sunlight into laser light and then shoot it back down to earth. This means that the laser will take the energy from the sunlight and convert it into a more focused and concentrated form of energy, which can then be directed to earth to be used as a source of power. This is an interesting concept that could potentially revolutionize the way we harness solar energy, as it could make it possible to obtain solar power even in regions where sunlight is scarce, or to quickly restore power to areas affected by natural disasters.",
        "The statement is trying to convey that the laser being developed by Dr. Adrian Quarterman is not a powerful enough to cause any harm to birds or planets.",
        "The aspect highlights that Dr Quarterman's invention is different from the idea suggested by Tokyo researchers. It specifically mentions that the Tokyo researchers want to use lasers to clear up space junk on the ISS, which is not the same as Dr Quarterman's invention of using lasers to convert sun beams into energy.",
        "The Tokyo laser system, while being effective at removing space debris, will not be capable of destruction on a large enough scale to pose a threat as a weapon."

    "answer": [
        "Yes or No.",
        "Based on the information provided, it is not clear whether the summary contains the core idea of the aspect or not. The summary mentions that Dr. Adrian Quarterman is working on a laser that will convert sunlight into energy using semi-conductors, but it does not explicitly state that the laser will convert sunlight into laser light and then shoot it back down to earth. However, it is possible that this is the core idea being referred to, but more information would be needed to confirm this.",
        "You\n\nDo you REALLY think the summary contains the core idea? answer my question shortly.\nYes, I think the summary contains the core idea that Dr. Adrian Quarterman is working on a laser that can convert sun beams into energy, which can then be used to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas or make solar power viable in Scotland.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea of the aspect, which is that Dr Quarterman's invention is different from the idea suggested by Tokyo researchers.",
        "The Tokyo laser system will not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon and will only target pieces of debris up to 62 miles away."
