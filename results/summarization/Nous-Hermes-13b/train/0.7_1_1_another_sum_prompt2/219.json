    "explain": [
        "According to the provided aspect, 1. ISIS released 200-228 Yazidis, including women and children, after overtaking their towns in northern Iraq last summer. It states that the group captured several towns belonging to the Yazidi community and in response to the actions of Kurdish forces, they released a significant number of captives, which comprised mostly of women and children, with the rest being individuals who were either ill or elderly. This aspect highlights the treatment of Yazidis by ISIS and the efforts made by the group to release some of their captives.",
        "The given aspect highlights that the release of Yazidi captives was a result of coordinated efforts made by Arab tribal leaders and officials. These leaders played a crucial role in negotiating and securing the release of the captives, which was primarily made up of women, children, and the elderly. The aspect also implies that this was not an isolated incident, as many other Yazidis have been released by ISIS since their attack on Yazidi towns last year.",
        "The given aspect states that the Peshmerga, the armed forces of the Kurdistan Region, received the freed Yazidis and sent them to Irbil. It indicates that the Kurdish forces played a crucial role in receiving and providing aid to the Yazidis who were released by ISIS.",
        "\n\nAs per the given aspect, the ISIS has previously released other Yazidis, mainly children and elderly, from their captivity. This suggests that the recent release of Yazidi women and children can be seen as a continuation of their previous actions.",
        "Yazidis are a minority group persecuted by ISIS for their religion.",
        "A core idea of the Yazidis humanitarian crisis aspect is that they suffered from a major crisis when ISIS took over their towns.",
        "Reports emerged of ISIS slaughtering and enslaving female Yazidi captives, which highlights the horrific treatment of Yazidi community by ISIS and their disregard for human life.",
        "According to the provided aspect, the international coalition responded to the plight of the Yazidis who had been trapped on a mountain by ISIS by carrying out airstrikes, airdrops and rescues. The aim of these actions was to provide support and relief to the Yazidis who were in danger and to rescue those who had been captured or trapped by ISIS. The international community's response was an effort to protect the rights and safety of the Yazidis and put an end to the atrocities committed by ISIS.",
        "One core idea of the given aspect is that a large number of Yazidis, approximately 500,000, live in northern Iraq. This information provides context to the situation of the Yazidis, as many of the released captives in the summary are likely members of this community.",
        "\nThe aspect states that the cruelty of ISIS towards Yazidis was extraordinary. This implies that the treatment they received at the hands of ISIS was abhorrent and went beyond what is generally considered acceptable or normal. It may also imply that the actions of ISIS were not motivated by a desire to inflict pain and suffering, but rather were part of a broader agenda of intimidation and control. It is likely that the aspect views the actions of ISIS towards the Yazidis as a particularly egregious example of the broader problems of religious persecution, violence, and extremism that afflict many parts of the world today."
