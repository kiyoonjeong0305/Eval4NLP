    "explain": [
        "a core idea of this aspect is that the Yazidis who were kidnapped by ISIS and were not released were either ill or elderly. According to the summary, only 228 Yazidis were released by ISIS, which included women, children, and the elderly or sick. Additionally, it is not clear what motivated the release but it is mentioned that the freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga and transported to Irbil.",
        "\nThe aspect describes the involvement of Arab tribal leaders in facilitating the release of Yazidi captives from the Islamic State. These leaders played a crucial role in negotiating with the militants and securing the safe return of the Yazidis to their home in Irbil. It highlights the importance of local leadership and community initiatives in resolving conflicts and securing the release of captives.",
        "According to the given aspect, it is stated that most of the people who were released from captivity were not combatants or able-bodied individuals. In fact, they were predominantly ill or elderly persons. This highlights the fact that the captors had no intention of releasing the fittest members of the Yazidi community, but rather, they chose to release those who were weak and vulnerable, showing a shocking lack of humanity and compassion.",
        "The given aspect states that the recent release of Yazidis by Islamic State comes after they had released others before that. This suggests that the terrorist organization has a history of freeing captives, possibly in an effort to maintain support or as a tactical move. The fact that they have done this before may also indicate that they are responding to pressure from coalition forces or other external factors.",
        "The Yazidis are a minority group who have been persecuted for their religion despite being one of the oldest religions in the world.",
        "The aspect highlights the extreme cruelty that ISIS has inflicted on the Yazidi community.\n\nHow does it relate to the summary?\nIt indicates the severe and appalling treatment of the Yazidis, likely contributing to the need for their release as well as the decision to send them to safety in Irbil.",
        "The release of Yazidis from captivity by the Islamic State might have been facilitated by airstrikes and rescues conducted by the U.S.-led international coalition."

    "answer": [
        "Based on the given aspect, the summary does not explicitly state that the core idea is that the released Yazidis were women, children, and the elderly or sick. However, it does indicate that the released Yazidis were received by the Peshmerga and transported to Irbil, implying that they were not in good physical condition.",
        "\nThe aspect describes the facilitation of the release of Yazidi captives by Arab tribal leaders. It does not mention the motivation for their release or the reasons they were released. Therefore, it cannot be said that this aspect contains the core idea of the summary.",
        "The summary does not explicitly contain the core idea of the aspect, which is that most of the released individuals were ill or elderly. However, it does provide information about the general demographics of those who were released, which can be inferred to support the idea that the captors were more interested in punishing the Yazidi community than fighting a battle.",
        "\nYes, the summary does contain the core idea that the release of Yazidis by Islamic State is not an isolated event but has happened before. \nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea that the release comes after the group previously released others. \nYes, the summary does contain the core idea that the released Yazidis were received by Peshmerga and sent to Irbil. \nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea that Nuri Osman says it is not immediately clear what motivated the release.",
        "The summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary is about the release of Yazidi captives and their reception by the Peshmerga. The aspect, on the other hand, is about the religious persecution of the Yazidi minority group.",
        "Yes, I can see how the aspect of ISIS's cruelty towards the Yazidi community is related to the summary. It indicates that the released Yazidis were likely victims of ISIS's abuse and that their release was likely due in part to efforts to alleviate their suffering.",
        "Yes, I do. The aspect mentions that the release occurred after international coalition airstrikes and rescues, indicating that these actions may have played a role in freeing the Yazidis."
