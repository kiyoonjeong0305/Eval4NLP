    "explain": [
        "The core idea of the aspect is that Donald Sterling's former female companion, V. Stiviano, has been ordered to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts that she received from him. This happened after Sterling's wife sued her for targeting wealthy older men and accusing her of stealing from her husband. The judge's decision to order Stiviano to pay back the gifts is a result of Sterling's racist remarks that cost him his NBA team.",
        "The aspect states that lawsuit filed by Rochelle Sterling (Shelly) against V. Stiviano accuses her of targeting wealthy older men and receiving luxury gifts including luxury cars, Easter bunny costume, blender and a lace thong from Donald Sterling.",
        "According to the aspect, Shelly Sterling sued V. Stiviano for gifts her husband, Donald Sterling, had given her. A Los Angeles judge has ordered her to pay back $2.6 million. This legal action took place after Mrs. Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men to exploit them.",
        "The aspect states that Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of him arguing with V. Stiviano about her posting pictures with African-Americans on social media.",
        "The aspect states that Donald Sterling, the former owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was banned from the National Basketball Association (NBA) in response to his racist remarks.

        "I am sorry, but I don't understand your question. Could you please clarify it?",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Yes, the core idea is present in the summary. It states that Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team and his former female companion has lost big in a court case. However, it was not his downfall that came from an audio recording of him arguing with Stiviano, but rather his wife's lawsuit against her. The summary contains the core idea of the aspect, but the aspect is more specific about the cause of Sterling's downfall.",
        "The summary has nothing to do with the aspect. It is about a dispute between Shelly Sterling and V. Stiviano regarding gifts and targeting rich older men, not about the NBA's punishment of Donald Sterling. Therefore, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect."
