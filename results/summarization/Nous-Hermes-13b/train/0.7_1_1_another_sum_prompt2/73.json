    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that two passengers found dead inside their stateroom on the ship appear to have died in a murder-suicide. This means that one person killed the other person before taking their own life, which is believed to have been the cause of their death.",
        "The given aspect states that two guests were found dead inside their stateroom. It implies that the deaths of the two passengers were discovered while they were on board the ship and in one of the rooms where they were staying. The fact that they were found \"inside their stateroom\" suggests that they were not in a public area or out on the open deck, but rather in their private quarters. It implies that the deaths may have been unexpected, and likely surprised or shocked the other passengers and crew on the ship. The statement also implies that the matter is under investigation and that authorities in San Juan, Puerto Rico are involved.",
        "The aspect highlights that the cabin was secured after the discovery of the dead passengers, indicating that the authorities were quickly notified, and the crime scene was preserved.",
        "The aspect states that the ship is currently in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This means that the ship has arrived at its current location and is no longer in Tampa, Florida where it had departed from.",
        "The core idea of the aspect is that the cleaning staff discovered the deceased passengers after knocking on the cabin's door.",
        "The FBI is investigating the two passengers who were found dead inside their stateroom on the ship in San Juan, Puerto Rico."

    "answer": [
        "It is mentioned in the Summary that two passengers were found dead inside their stateroom. However, it does not mention the cause of their death or any indication that it was a murder-suicide.",

The aspect specifically states that two guests were found dead inside their stateroom, while the summary only mentions that two passengers were found dead on the ship and does not mention where they were found or how they died.",
        "Aspect: There is no direct relationship between the summary and the aspect.",
        "The summary does not mention that the ship has arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It only mentions that the ship had departed from Tampa, Florida on March 29 and that two passengers were found dead in their stateroom on the ship, which is now in San Juan, Puerto Rico.",
        "I couldn't really understand. Could you please rephrase your question?",
