        "1. A landslide caused a section of land near Japan's Hokkaido Island coast to drop and pivot into the air, resulting in 1,000ft of seabed being forced to the surface overnight.",

    "explain": [
        "A landslide caused a section of land near Japan's Hokkaido Island coast to drop and pivot into the air, resulting in 1,000ft of seabed being forced to the surface overnight. A different landslide event in Rausu caused some coast to rise, but the residents are not sure why this is happening. These events are both caused by land shifting due to natural forces, resulting in changes to the coastline.",
        "The aspect states that the new stretch of coastline appeared unexpectedly and has not expanded further than its initial size.",
        "The aspect states that the landslide occurred due to melting of ice and snow causing a section of land to drop. This means that the instability of the terrain in this area is a result of natural processes like the melting of glaciers and snow, which can cause movement of the earth. This aspect also implies that the residents of Rausu should be cautious of further changes to the landscape that could be caused by such natural processes."

        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea of the aspect. The aspect states that the landslide occurred due to melting of ice and snow causing a section of land to drop, and the summary mentions that a landslide in the area of Rausu caused an extra stretch of coastline to rise. Both the summary and the aspect are talking about the same event, which was caused by the melting of ice and snow."
