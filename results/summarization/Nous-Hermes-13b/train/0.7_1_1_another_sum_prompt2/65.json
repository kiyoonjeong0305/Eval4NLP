        "\nExplain: Ross Barkley, an untried player, inexplicably took the 10th minute kick awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. This resulted in the Burnley goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, saving Barkley's effort at Goodison Park.\n\nCore idea: The summary states that Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley.",
