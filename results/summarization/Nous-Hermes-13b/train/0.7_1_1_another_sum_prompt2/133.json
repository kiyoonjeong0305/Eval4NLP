    "explain": [
        "One core idea of the aspect is that a teacher at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, allowed pupils to change their exam answers, which resulted in the annulment of the school's SATs results.",
        "The given aspect states that the teacher, Ian Guffick, admitted to the allegations and said he didn't ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. This means that the teacher did not ask the pupils to change the content of their answers, but to improve the way they were written so that they were easier to read and understand. The teacher's intention was not to cheat or manipulate the exam results, but to help the pupils better present their knowledge and skills on the exam.",
        "One of the core ideas of the aspect is that the teacher was punished severely for his misconduct by being banned from teaching for at least two years by the Department for Education (DFE). The DFE took this strict action due to the seriousness of the teacher's offense, which was altering the exam answers of his pupils and asking them to make changes to the national curriculum. The teacher's actions were considered a breach of exam rules and were brought to the attention of school officials who then notified the DFE, leading to the teacher's punishment. This aspect highlights the importance of adhering to exam rules and the consequences of misconduct for both teachers and students."
