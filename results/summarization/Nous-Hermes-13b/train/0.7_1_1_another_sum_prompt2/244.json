The club has incentivised contracts in place to ensure financial fairplay compliance, and the players could lose a considerable amount of money if they do not reach the desired European football standard.",
        "The summary mentions that in order to comply with financial fairplay requirements, Manchester City have given contracts to their star players like Sergio Aguero, David Silva, Joe Hart and Yaya Toure that include incentives. These incentives involve the players losing £500,000 each if the club fails to qualify for the Champions League this season. Additionally, another aspect stated that a failure to finish in the top four of the Premier League would also result in a loss of £12 million in bonuses for the players. The club's decision to give these incentivised contracts is aimed at ensuring that they remain within the financial fairplay rules and avoid any penalties that may result from overspending.",
        "The aspect states that Manchester City's manager, Manuel Pellegrini, has admitted that the team's season has disintegrated, with seven losses and early exits in both the FA Cup and the Champions League.

Due to Manchester City's financial fairplay requirements, the club has given its players incentivised contracts that include bonus payments for reaching certain targets. One of these targets is qualifying for the Champions League group stages, and if the team fails to do so, Toure and Milner will miss out on a significant portion of their bonuses. This means that they will lose around £500,000 each if the team fails to qualify.",
        "\n\nAccording to the given aspect, there are five teams in the Premier League - West Ham, Aston Villa, Tottenham, QPR, and Southampton - whose remaining fixtures will determine their fate in the league. It is likely that all of these teams will be fighting for survival in the league and will be facing tough competition in their remaining matches. The teams that perform well and secure more points in their remaining matches are likely to stay in the league, while those that perform poorly may be relegated. Ultimately, the outcome of these remaining fixtures will play a vital role in determining the final standings of these teams in the league.",
