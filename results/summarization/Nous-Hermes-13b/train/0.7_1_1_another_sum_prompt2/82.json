    "explain": [
        "The core idea of this aspect is that Orlando City, a Major League Soccer (MLS) side, are interested in signing Manchester United misfit Javier Hernandez. This would be a significant move for the Florida-based franchise, as they are coached by former Everton and Manchester City striker Adrian Heath, and Hernandez would be a commercial draw for the team.",
        "The given aspect states that eight European football clubs are also interested in Hernandez. This suggests that the Mexican international forward, although surplus to requirements at Manchester United, has a high demand from other teams. These European sides likely see Hernandez as a valuable asset in their efforts to improve their squads. As a result, it is likely that there will be intense competition for his signature. United, Southampton, Stoke, West Ham, and Everton will have to work hard to acquire his services, or risk losing him to a rival team.",
        "Aspect: 3. Southampton, Stoke, West Ham and Everton are interested in Hernandez.\nCore idea: Several English Premier League teams (Southampton, Stoke, West Ham and Everton) are also interested in signing Mexican striker Javier Hernandez from Manchester United.",
        "The aspect states that Manchester United is willing to sell Javier Hernandez for around £8million. This suggests that the English club values the Mexican international at £8million and is open to the possibility of selling him to interested teams.",
        "This aspect highlights the fact that besides the MLS side Orlando City, other big European clubs such as Wolfsburg from Germany, AC Milan from Italy, and Lazio and Inter Milan from Italy, are also interested in signing Mexican striker Javier Hernandez. This further emphasizes Hernandez's market value and shows that he has a lot of potential suitors, which increases the likelihood of him securing a move to a new club.",
        "One of the aspects discussed in the given passage is that Manchester United has made a revised contract offer to Andreas Pereira.",
        "Pereira is a wanted man among several clubs including PSG after impressing during his breakthrough season at United.",
        "The aspect states that four major European clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord, have shown interest in signing 19-year-old Brazilian midfielder Bruno Fernandes de Souza, also known as Bruno, who currently plays for French club Saint-Étienne.",
        "The given aspect states that Andreas Pereira rejected Manchester United's opening contract offer. Andreas Pereira is a professional football player who plays for Manchester United as a midfielder. The club had offered him a contract, but he turned it down. This shows that Pereira is seeking better terms and conditions in his contract, which may include higher wages, more playing time, or improved benefits. This could indicate that he is looking to secure his future with the club or pursuing other opportunities.",
        "10. Pereira was on the bench against Aston Villa, but this does not necessarily mean he will play in United's next match. It is possible that Solskjaer wanted to give him some game time from the bench in case the team needed a boost in the second half but the substitution was not due to injury or performance issues."
