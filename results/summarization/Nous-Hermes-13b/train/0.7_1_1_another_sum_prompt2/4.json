    "explain": [
        "Luigi Costa, an Italian citizen, is accused of stomping on his elderly neighbor Terrence Freebody's head, cutting his throat, and stabbing him multiple times in the dining room of his home on Mugga Way, Red Hill, Canberra in July 2012.",
        "The aspect states that Professor Paul Mullen, after examining Costa after the attack, believes that there was evidence of his declining state of mind in both the lead-up to the incident and during the event. This highlights that Costa's mental health was not in a stable condition and may have contributed to the murder.",
        "\nThe forensic psychiatrist told the court that the triple 0 calls made by Costa during the incident suggest his mood fluctuated from moment to moment. \n\nThis core idea indicates that the mental health state of Costa, who allegedly killed his neighbor, is unstable as he couldn't maintain a consistent mood during the incident.",
        "The aspect mentioned highlights the confusion and mental decline of the accused, Luigi Costa, during the murder of his elderly neighbor. This can be inferred from the trail of feces found from the crime scene to the toilet where he was found by the police.",
        "The prosecutor suggested that Costa was not truthful with Professor Mullin during their interview, and that he was faking forgetfulness.",
        "If the jury accepts that Costa was suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time of the murder, he may be found not guilty as his unstable mindset at the time of the attack will be considered as a mitigating factor."
