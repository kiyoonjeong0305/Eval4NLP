    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that last week Demelza Poldark was not visibly showing that she was pregnant, but now she has given birth to the show's newest addition. This implies that she concealed her pregnancy and managed to keep it a secret until she gave birth.",
        "The aspect states that the fans will see Ross Poldark gazing lovingly at his new baby daughter within ten minutes of tomorrow night's episode.",
        "\n\nWomen across the country long to settle down with Ross, but his heart seems off the market.  This means that the women in the country are attracted to Ross Poldark and want to be with him, but he doesn't seem to be interested in dating anyone at the moment. His heart seems to be unavailable for romantic relationships.",
        "The aspect highlights concerns regarding the timeline of Demelza's pregnancy in the context of the show. It states that it is questionable that Demelza could have been pregnant for just one week, considering the events that transpired in the previous episode. This contradicts the previous assumption that she was just starting to show.",
        "\nDemelza suddenly goes into labor just after she talks about being eight months pregnant. This implies that her labor may have been induced or accelerated by the stress of the discussion.",
        "The core idea of the aspect that \"Poldark's fast relationship didn't go unnoticed by fans\" is that the rapid progression of the romantic relationship between the two main characters in the TV series, Poldark, was not liked or appreciated by the show's fans.",
        "The aspect highlights that the previous pregnancy on the show also progressed quickly, just like the current one."

    "answer": [
        "It depends on the context in which the summary was given. If it was specifically about Demelza's pregnancy and how she concealed it, then yes, the core idea is contained within the summary. If not, then the summary may not directly contain the core idea.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The aspect states that Ross Poldark will gaze lovingly at his new baby daughter within ten minutes of tomorrow night's episode, while the summary only mentions that fans will see him doing so.",
        "No, I don't think the summary contains the core idea. It's about Ross Poldark's love towards his new baby daughter and not about his love life. The aspect you provided is not relevant to the summary.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea as it explicitly states that Ross Poldark gazes lovingly at his new baby daughter and that Demelza is the proud mother to the show's latest addition. However, the aspect highlights an issue with the timeline of Demelza's pregnancy.",
        "\nNo, the summary doesn't contain the core idea of the aspect. The aspect mentions that Demelza gives birth minutes after talking about being eight months pregnant, but there is no mention of this event or any indication of labor in the summary.",
        "Based on the given summary and aspect, it can be inferred that the core idea of the aspect is that the relationship between Ross Poldark and Demelza in the TV series, Poldark, progressed quickly and this did not go unnoticed by fans, who did not appreciate it.",
        "It depends on what you mean by \"core idea.\" If the aspect is referring to the speed of Demelza Poldark's pregnancy, then yes, that idea is present in the summary. However, if you are asking me to evaluate if the summary captures the essence of the show or provides a fair representation of the aspects discussed, then that is a subjective question and the answer would depend on individual opinions."
