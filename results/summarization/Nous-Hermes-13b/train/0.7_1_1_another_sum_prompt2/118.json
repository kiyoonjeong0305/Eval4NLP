Furthermore, repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Therefore, the aspect highlights the possible link between antibiotic use and obesity in young children.",

        "The given aspect highlights the concern over the overuse of antibiotics and its consequences. It suggests that the excessive use of antibiotics is leading to their decreased effectiveness in treating infections, and this could become a major health issue in the future.",
