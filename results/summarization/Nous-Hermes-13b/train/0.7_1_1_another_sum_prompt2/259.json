        "Paul Merson, a former footballer and pundit, has been critical of Andros Townsend's performance after being called up to the recent England squad. Despite being brought on to the field in injury time in his team's 0-0 draw with Burnley, Merson took another opportunity to criticize Townsend's play. The midfielder has been the target of Merson's criticism in the past as well.",
        "Andros Townsend scored a stunning goal for the England national football team against Italy in a Euro qualifier match. The goal was an excellent piece of individual play, as he received the ball on the right wing, dribbled past two defenders, cut inside a third, and then unleashed a curling shot into the top corner of the net to level the score at 1-1. Townsend's goal will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout moments of the Euro qualifying campaign for England, and cemented his place in the starting line-up for the team under new manager Gareth Southgate.",
