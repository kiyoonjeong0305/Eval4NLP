    "explain": [
        "The given aspect states that a former royal footman claims that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in 1978. This core idea suggests that there may have been a culture of sexual misconduct and exploitation within the royal household at that time, and that this could potentially have been covered up by palace officials.",
        "The given aspect states that police are investigating the claim after it was revealed by the Sunday People. This implies that the alleged incident of sexual abuse that Christopher Lawler experienced on his first day working at Clarence House was not reported or taken seriously initially and it was only after it was revealed by the Sunday People newspaper that the police decided to investigate the claim.",
        "The aspect highlights that the incident occurred on Christopher Lawler's first day working at Clarence House.",
        "The given aspect states that Christopher Lawler reported the incident of being pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House to the palace officials. However, he was ignored and left the job immediately.",

    "answer": [
        "It seems that the given aspect, which describes an allegation that Clarence House aides tried to force a former royal footman into an orgy in 1978, is not directly present in the summary. The summary focuses on an incident where a male member of staff allegedly groped Christopher Lawler on his first day working at Clarence House, leaving him in tears and causing him to leave the job the same day. Mr. Lawler came forward with his story after allegations of cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring were being investigated.",
        "No, I do not think the summary contains the core idea. The summary only provides information about Christopher Lawler's experience of being pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House and that he left the job the same day. It does not mention anything about the police investigating the claim or the Sunday People revealing the incident.",
        "It could be argued that the aspect does not contain a core idea related to the summary. The aspect simply provides additional information about where and when the incident occurred, without providing any further context or explanation.",
        "4. The footman reported the incident to Clarence House but was ignored and left the job immediately. -------------------------------------------Yes, the aspect accurately captures the core idea of the summary. The aspect describes the action taken by the footman after the incident occurred, which was to report it to Clarence House. However, his report was ignored and he left the job immediately as a result.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of this aspect.",
        "\n\tThe summary gives a brief account of the incident and the action the victim took. However, it does not contain any information regarding the core idea of the aspect you mentioned.\n\tThe aspect states that the retired royal aide denies any involvement in the incident. However, it does not explicitly state the reason for his denial. The mention of his work at Balmoral during the time of the incident could imply that he was not present at Clarence House where the incident occurred, but this is not explicitly stated. \n\tTherefore, it cannot be concluded that the summary contains the core idea of the aspect.",
        "Yes, I think the aspect \"The Palace has promised to cooperate with any police probe\" is related to the summary as it shows the Palace's willingness to assist the police if necessary."
