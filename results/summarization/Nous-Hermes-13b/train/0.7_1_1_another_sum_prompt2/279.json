    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that Jacob Phillips, a young accountant, died after falling down a 70ft cliff while running from a taxi to avoid paying the fare.",
        "The core idea of this aspect is that the taxi driver wishes he had known where Jacob was headed so he could have prevented his death. If the driver had known, he could have taken proper precautions to ensure Jacob's safety.",
        "The aspect states that accountant Jacob Phillips died after falling down a 70ft cliff. It adds that he was killed when he jumped over a fence in the dark. This means that his death was not an accident but a result of his own actions. It shows that there was a lack of caution on his part and that he took a risk that ultimately led to his death.",
        "Jacob Phillips' death was not solely due to falling off a cliff. He was in a precarious situation even before he fell due to the fact that he couldn't pay for the taxi and ran from the driver, which then resulted in his unfortunate demise.",
        "The core idea of the aspect is that the accountant was found dead at the bottom of the cliff after being discovered by a dog walker."
