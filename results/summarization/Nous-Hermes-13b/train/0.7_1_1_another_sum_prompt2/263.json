The television series, Poldark, has been following the characters' lives for several years now, and one of the main characters, Demelza, is currently pregnant. According to the aspect provided, Demelza's pregnancy is moving faster than normal, and it is revealed in the show's latest episode.

        "The aspect highlights that the pregnancy storyline in the show has advanced quickly, skipping past several stages of pregnancy within a short period of time.
