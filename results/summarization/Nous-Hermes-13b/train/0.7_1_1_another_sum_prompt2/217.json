        "1. An FBI agent's sniper rifle was stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot.",
        "2. The rifle was inside a hard rifle case and was properly secured to a truck safe with padlocks and chains.",
        "3. The thief broke the rear right passenger-side window and used a rope to pull the case free from the lock.",
        "4. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door.",
        "5. The theft happened just a week before President Obama visited Utah.",
        "6. Surveillance cameras were not present at the hotel.",
        "7. Police found skid marks and rope pieces near the car.",
        "8. The Secret Service was notified, but could not comment on increased security.",

        "10. The theft happened overnight from the parking lot ofÂ Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying."
    ],
    "explain": [
        "The core idea of this aspect is that a sniper rifle belonging to an FBI agent was stolen from a hotel parking lot in Salt Lake City.",
        "The aspect highlights that the gun was properly secured inside a hard rifle case and was further secured to a truck safe with padlocks and chains. This implies that the owner of the gun took necessary precautions to ensure that the gun was safe and secure from unauthorized access. This could have been done to prevent any potential accidents, thefts or misuse.",
        "The key detail to understand from this aspect is the method used by the thief to steal the gun from the vehicle. The rear right passenger-side window of the truck was broken, and then a rope was tied around the handle of the rifle case or a cable lock, using the momentum from another vehicle to break the handle free from the lock. This demonstrates the ingenuity and determination of the thief in carrying out the theft.",
        "The aspect mentions that the thief broke the rear right passenger-side window to steal the gun.",
        "The aspect highlights that the theft of the gun occurred just a week before President Obama visited Utah. This suggests that the theft may have been politically motivated or timed to coincide with the president's visit. It also raises questions about the safety and security of the president during his visit.",
        "Surveillance cameras are essential for monitoring and recording activities in any area, including hotels. However, in the given scenario, the hotel Springhill Suites did not have any surveillance cameras installed. This means that there is no visual recording of the crime scene or any evidence that can be gathered from the surveillance footage. This aspect suggests that the lack of security measure, in this case, the absence of cameras, could have contributed to the crime or made it easier for the thieves to commit the crime.",
        "The given aspect suggests that there were skid marks and rope pieces found near the car, which were likely left behind by the thief as they stole the gun. These skid marks and rope pieces indicate that the thief may have backed up a vehicle to the car in order to break the rear right passenger-side window with enough force to remove the gun case from the truck safe. The rope pieces suggest that the thief used a rope or cable lock to attach the gun case to the vehicle they were backing up, and then broke the handle free from the lock with the help of the vehicle's momentum.",
        "The Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency responsible for protecting the President and other high-ranking government officials, could not comment on potential increased security measures taken at the hotel or elsewhere due to the incident involving a stolen rifle.",
        "This aspect of the summary suggests that the police are uncertain about whether the thief intentionally targeted the agent's car or if it was a random act of opportunistic theft. According to the information provided, the thief may have noticed the case and rifle through the broken window and used the momentum from a moving vehicle to break the case free from the lock or handle. The fact that the serial number has been entered into the national crime information computer suggests that this is a serious matter and that the authorities are actively looking for the stolen rifle.",
        "The aspect states that the theft happened overnight from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites, where the agent was staying. This means that the thief stole the gun while the agent was asleep in their hotel room."
