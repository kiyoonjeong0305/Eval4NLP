They suggest that a life sentence without parole would be a more appropriate punishment.",

        "Not necessarily. While the Richards' desire to move on from their grief and look towards a better future is mentioned in the summary, it is not the main focus of the text. The main focus is on Tsarnaev's guilt and the opinion piece written by the Richards."
