        "It is not possible for me to determine the core idea of the aspect without further information. Can you please provide me with more context or details about the aspect?",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea. The core idea of the aspect is that the victim of Maurice Van Ryn's sexual abuse spoke up about her experience when she found out he had been caught. The summary mentions that she is scared for her future relationships, but this is not the core idea of the aspect.",
        "I do not think the summary contains the core idea because it only briefly mentions the victim's fear of future relationships and does not elaborate on the impact of the abuse. The aspect provides more detailed information on the victim's fears and the impact of the abuse.",
        "As I have already provided the response to the given aspect, which is \"The young woman is concerned about the possibility of Maurice Van Ryn being released from custody, as it may affect her trust and behavior in future relationships with men.\", therefore, I don't think the summary contains the core idea.",
        "The aspect highlights that the victim has been suffering from depression since she was 14 which resulted in her hospitalization for self-harm and attempted suicide. The summary mentions that she is scared for her future relationships but doesn't give much detail about her emotional state, so this aspect sheds more light on her emotional struggles following the abuse."
