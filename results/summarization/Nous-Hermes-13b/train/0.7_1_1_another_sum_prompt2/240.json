    "explain": [
        "The core idea of this aspect is that Orlando City, a football club in the US, has shown interest in signing Javier Hernandez, a striker who plays for Manchester United in the English Premier League. The interest from Orlando City stems from their desire to capitalize on Hernandez's commercial appeal, especially among their Latin American fanbase. Last week, the club made enquiries about the possibility of a deal.",
        "The aspect states that the Latin-American fanbase of Orlando City would welcome Javier Hernandez with open arms due to their large Latin-American fanbase.",
        "The given aspect states that eight European clubs are also interested in signing Javier Hernandez, who is currently on loan at Real Madrid and is frustrated with his limited playing time. The European interest in Hernandez further highlights his attractiveness as a transfer target and could make it difficult for MLS side Orlando City to secure his services, given the stiff competition from top-flight clubs on the continent.",
        "All the five clubs Southampton, Stoke, West Ham, Everton and Wolfsburg are interested in signing Hernandez for around £8million.",
        "The given aspect states that Manchester United is willing to sell Javier Hernandez for around £8million and has made a revised contract offer to Andreas Pereira.",
        "The core idea of this aspect is that Andreas Pereira, a young Brazilian midfielder at Manchester United, is being pursued by several European clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich, if he does not agree to a new contract with United. The clubs are likely to make offers for Pereira during the upcoming transfer window, as his current deal with United expires in the summer of 2023. Thus, United will have to act fast and either agree a new deal with Pereira or cash in on the player before the transfer window closes.",
        "This aspect mentions a rejected contract offer made to United player Andreas Pereira. The club offered him a contract, but he turned it down and has been on the bench for their last game. It's not specified whether or not he's playing in their upcoming games or if he's currently considering other offers."

    "answer": [
        "It depends on how you define \"core idea.\" While the summary does mention that Orlando City is interested in signing Hernandez, it doesn't delve into the specific reasons behind their interest or the details of their pursuit. Therefore, the core idea of the aspect, which is Orlando City's interest in Hernandez and the reasons behind it, is not present in the summary.",
        "I apologize but I'm not able to understand your question. Could you please rephrase it?",
        "Not necessarily. The aspect provides additional information about Hernandez's situation and the level of interest from European teams, but it does not directly relate to the club's interest in signing him.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary is about Orlando City's interest in signing Hernandez while the aspect is about the interest of five other clubs in signing him for £8million.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The aspect is independent of the summary and provides additional information about the possible sale of Javier Hernandez and the contract offer made to Andreas Pereira.",
        "No. The aspect mentioned by the text about Andreas Pereira is not present in the summary.",
        "Yes, it does- the summary mentions that Orlando City are interested in signing Manchester United player Javier Hernandez, who is a Mexican international. The team's coach Adrian Heath is known for his time with Everton and Manchester City, and the team has a large Latin American fanbase that would likely be drawn to the signing."
