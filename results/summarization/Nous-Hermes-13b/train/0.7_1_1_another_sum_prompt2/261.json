    "explain": [
        "The aspect highlights the video that showcases a man interacting with his blood parrot cichlid through stroking and playing with it.",
        "The core idea of this aspect is that the fish requires daily physical interaction with the man to feel content and happy. It has been observed that when the man fails to play with the fish, it gets frustrated and shows signs of unease. This demonstrates the importance of physical touch in the fish's well-being and the strong bond it shares with its owner.",
        "The aspect states that the man plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day by massaging and stroking it with his finger. It indicates that the man has formed a strong bond with his fish and enjoys spending time with it through such physical interactions. The aspect also suggests that the man is attentive to his fish's need for physical touch and that it is an important aspect of their relationship.",
        "The aspect notes that the fish initially swims away but then returns to be massaged by the man. Despite its initial attempts to swim away, the fish seems to trust the man enough to let him touch it.",
        "The aspect of the summary states that the fish was being bullied by other fish in the tank and was removed to prevent harm. This means that the fish was being physically harmed or intimidated by the other fish in the tank and the owner decided to remove it from the tank to keep it safe.",
        "The aspect highlights that during a massage, the fish becomes relaxed and calm, and swims around the man's fingers.",
        "The core idea of the aspect is that the man feeds the fish frozen blood worms by hand to interact with it. This means that the man physically interacts with the fish by using his hand to feed it, which helps them form a close bond and allows for further interactions such as touching and stroking."

        "\nYes, in fact the core idea of the aspect is mentioned in the summary. As mentioned before, the summary states that cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch, but that does not prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and then treats it to a massage. The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger. The fact that the fish initially swims away but then returns to be massaged by the man is mentioned in the summary.",
        "No, the given aspect does not seem to fit well with the summary. While it is mentioned that the fish is being massaged, there is no mention of it being taken out of the tank or being bullied by other fish. The two ideas seem to be unrelated.",
        "Yes, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect. The summary talks about cats and dogs having the advantage over marine pets in interacting with humans through touch, but it does not mention the man's interaction with the fish through feeding."
