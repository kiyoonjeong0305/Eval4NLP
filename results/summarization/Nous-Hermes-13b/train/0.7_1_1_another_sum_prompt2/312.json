        "Professor Paul Mullen, a forensic psychiatrist, examined Luigi Costa's state of mind after the killing of his elderly neighbor, Terence Freebody, in July 2012 in Red Hill, Canberra. Mullen believes that there was evidence of Costa's mental state declining both in the run-up to the incident and during the event. To support this claim, Mullen cited the triple-zero calls that Costa made \"almost certainly\" during the incident, which showed that his mood fluctuated from \"moment to moment.\"",

This suggests that Costa's mental state was unstable and changing throughout the event.",
