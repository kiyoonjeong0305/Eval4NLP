    "explain": [
        "The aspect states that thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer's passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. This means that despite the inconvenience and stress caused by the delays, these individuals were not offered any financial reimbursement or compensation for the troubles they faced.",
        "Core idea of given aspect is that some of the managers at the Passport Office received bonuses while the agency was making a profit of £42 million during the chaos caused by the new passport application system.",
        "The aspect states that families who missed out on trips because of the passport chaos were not given refunds. This highlights the lack of empathy from the passport agency and the government towards these affected families. Despite the chaos and profits made during that time, the agency and the government did not take responsibility for the unforeseen consequences that their actions had on innocent families. This could have been an opportunity for the agency and the government to show compassion and rectify their mistakes, but instead, they chose to turn a blind eye.",
        "The passage states that only 2,191 compensation applications were approved and a total of £203,066 was paid out during the passport chaos.",
        "One core idea of the aspect is that the Passport Office made a significant surplus of £42.3 million.",
        "The aspect states that managers at the passport agency were handed £1.8 million in bonuses in 2013-14 while the agency made a £42 million profit, and despite the chaos caused by the Brexit deadline, the government refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips."

    "answer": [
        "It is not clear whether the summary contains the core idea of the aspect. The summary discusses the actions of managers at the passport agency and ministers during the chaos, while the aspect focuses on the lack of compensation for holidaymakers affected by the delay fiasco.",
        "I disagree with your opinion that the summary contains the core idea. In my analysis, I found that the summary only mentions the profits made by the Passport Office and the bonuses given to some of the managers without mentioning the relationship between these two events. Therefore, the core idea of the given aspect is not explicitly stated in the summary. \n\nIn conclusion, the aspect is providing context to the summary by focusing on the financial reward received by the managers at the Passport Office during a time when their organization was experiencing considerable success, while the summary seems more concerned with the impact on families who were forced to pay extra fees to obtain their passports.",
        "\nNo, the summary does not contain the core idea of the aspect mentioned above. The summary is about the profits made by the passport agency during the chaos, and the bonuses received by the managers, while the aspect talks about the lack of refunds for families who missed out on trips. The two pieces of information are not directly related, and the aspect does not provide any information about the profits or bonuses.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of the given aspect. The aspect states that only 2,191 compensation applications were approved and a total of £203,066 was paid out during the passport chaos, while the summary mentions that ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips.",
        "Do you REALLY think the summary contains the core idea? answer my question shortly.",
        "The aspect refers to the bonuses given to managers of the passport agency during the profitable year of 2013-14 while the agency made a £42 million profit."
