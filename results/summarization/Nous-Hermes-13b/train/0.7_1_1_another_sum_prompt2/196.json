    "explain": [
        "The core idea of this aspect is that there was an unexpected rise of seabed along Hokkaido Island's coastline due to a landslide. Geologists believe that this rise in seabed is due to the landslide that occurred near the coast. As a result, a mass of land has emerged and risen from 30 to 50 feet above sea level, measuring roughly 1,000 to 1,640 feet long and 100 feet wide. This has created an extra stretch of coastline that is now 50 feet above sea level.",
        "The given aspect suggests that the emergence of the clump of land on Hokkaido island, Japan is a result of a landslide. Geologists believe that the land has risen 30 to 50ft above sea level due to a landslide and the extra stretch of coastline has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface. This indicates that the landslide is the cause of the emergence of the land.",
        "The given aspect highlights the surprise of the locals to the emergence of the new stretch of land due to the landslide that occurred near Hokkaido Island in Japan. They witnessed the rise of the land some 50ft from the sea surface and the formation of a new clump of land as a result of the geological phenomenon.",
        "The given aspect talks about a newly discovered coastline near Rausu town in Hokkaido, Japan. This new coastline was formed due to the emergence of a clump of land that rose as high as 50ft from the sea surface. This emergence is believed to be a result of a landslide nearby and measures roughly 1,000 - 1,640 ft long and 100ft wide.",
        "The given aspect states that the landmass that has emerged on Hokkaido Island, Japan measures 1,000- 1,640ft long, that is, it spans over a length of 1,000 to 1,640 feet and is 100 feet wide. The core idea of this aspect is that the emerged landmass is quite large in terms of its dimensions and covers a considerable area of the island.",
        "The aspect highlights that despite the emergence of land due to a landslide nearby, the residents of Hokkaido Island, Japan did not experience any tremors or hear any sounds. This means that the emergence was not caused by any seismic or volcanic activity, and thus, the residents were not aware of it until it was discovered by geologists.",
        "The given aspect highlights that authorities believe the landslide that caused the mass of land to emerge happened overnight. This implies that the event was sudden and unexpected, and it may have occurred in a relatively short period of time. \n\nElaborate.\nElaborate: It could also suggest that there was no warning or indication of the landslide before it occurred, which could be a cause for concern for local residents and authorities. Additionally, the sudden nature of the event may make it more challenging to assess the full extent of the damage and risks associated with it. Overall, the aspect underscores the potential unpredictability and destructive power of natural events, and the need for preparedness and vigilance in dealing with them.",
        "The coastline not only extends the land, giving local residents a better view of the sea, but also provides a new perspective and a chance for the community to explore the natural beauty of the area.",
        "The given aspect states that the rise in land mass is not related to the earthquake that occurred in Nepal. It is a natural phenomenon caused by the emergence of a clump of land on Hokkaido island, Japan due to a landslide nearby."

    "answer": [
        "No, I do not think the summary contains the core idea. The core idea is about the unexpected rise of seabed along Hokkaido Island's coastline due to a landslide, while the summary is about a man standing on a clump of land on Hokkaido Island, Japan, and the geologists' belief that it is a result of a landslide.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea as it only provides information about the location, size, and the rise of the land due to the emergence. It does not mention the cause of the emergence or the landslide as the reason for the rise in land level. The aspect, on the other hand, specifically states that the landslide is the cause of the emergence of the land.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea of the given aspect.",
        "I apologize for the confusion in the previous responses. \nThe core idea of the given aspect is that a new coastline has been discovered near Rausu town in Hokkaido, Japan. This new coastline was formed due to the emergence of a clump of land that rose as high as 50ft from the sea surface. This emergence is believed to be a result of a landslide nearby and measures roughly 1,000 - 1,640 ft long and 100ft wide.",
        "Yes, the summary does contain the core idea. It provides important details about the landmass that has emerged on Hokkaido Island, Japan such as its location, the cause of its emergence, and its dimensions, which are elaborated upon in the aspect.",
        "The aspect does not contain any core idea from the summary. Instead, it provides additional information about the emergence of land that occurred due to a landslide nearby.",
        "I think the core idea of the given aspect is that there was no indication or warning of the landslide that caused the mass of land to emerge overnight.",
        "It seems that the aspect you have provided is not related to the summary as there is no mention of how the new coastline expands the view of local residents. Could you please provide me with the correct aspect or summary to work with?",
        "Yes, the summary suggests that the mass has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000 - 1,640 ft long, and 100ft wide after a landslide nearby."
