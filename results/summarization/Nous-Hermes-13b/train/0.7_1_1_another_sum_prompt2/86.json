        "1. The glowing blue letters that lit The Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday.",
        "2. The letters, which were expected to bring in $300,000 to $600,000, received no bids.",

        "4. Jackson wanted a new generation to own and enjoy the icon of the Yankees and New York City.",
        "5. Jackson bought the letters 'on a lark' and joked he might have gotten ahead of himself.",
        "6. If the letters were bought by a bidder in the U.S., Jackson promised to fly out and see the signage. ",
        "7. The auction also included a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s.",

    "explain": [
        "One core idea of the given aspect is that despite being a prominent feature of the Yankee Stadium, the glowing blue letters that lit The Bronx from above failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. This means that there were no bids made for the letters, indicating that they were not popular among the potential buyers, or the auction prices demanded by the seller were too high. This outcome contradicts the initial expectation that the letters would bring in a substantial amount of money, which ranged from $300,000 to $600,000, based on previous reports.",
        "The aspect states that despite being expected to fetch a high price of $300,000 to $600,000, the 13 letters, which were the iconic signage of the old Yankee Stadium, received no bids during the auction.",
        "The aspect states that the current owner of the signage, Reggie Jackson, purchased the letters for an undisclosed amount in 2008. This means that the information about how much money the signage was expected to bring in is no longer relevant, as it has already been sold.",
        "Jackson wanted to pass on the iconic symbol of the Yankees and New York City to a new generation.",
        "Jackson didn't buy the icons with the intention of making a significant profit, instead he bought them as a joke, implying that he might have overestimated their value.",
        "If the letters were bought by a bidder in the U.S., Jackson promised to fly out and see the signage. \nCore idea: Jackson expressed his appreciation towards the signage by offering to personally visit the new owner if they were located in the U.S.",
        "The given aspect describes that a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s was also included in the auction. This aspect highlights the additional item that was available for bidding during the auction. It provides more context to the general items up for sale and could be interesting information for car enthusiasts or collectors.",
        "The aspect states that the signs were expected to bring in a large amount of money, ranging from $300,000 to $600,000. However, their actual value was underestimated when they were auctioned off. While the letters were purchased for an undisclosed amount by Jackson, the highest bid for them at auction was only $112,500, which was considerably lower than the expected value."

        "Aspect: 2. The letters, which were expected to bring in $300,000 to $600,000, received no bids.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea of this aspect. The summary is focused on the expected earnings from the signage and the previous owner, while this aspect is about the purchase by Reggie Jackson and the amount he paid for it.",
        "Do it!  Are you sure?\nNo, I'm not sure. I made a mistake.",
        "No, the given aspect does not seem to be directly related to the core idea of the summary, which is about the expected monetary value of the signage.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea. The aspect you provided is a separate piece of information about Reggie Jackson that adds context to the story, but it does not relate directly to the main point of the summary.",
        "I understand that you are asking me to evaluate the aspect mentioned in the summary and provide an explanation of its core idea. However, the aspect mentioned in the summary is different from the one provided to me. Could you please clarify the aspect you would like me to explain from the given summary?",
        "No, the given aspect is not directly related to the summary. The aspect is about the estimated and actual value of the letters, while the summary is about their potential earnings and ownership."
