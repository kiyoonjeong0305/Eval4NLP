    "explain": [
        "Nabil Dirar, a former team-mate of Radamel Falcao at Porto, believes the Colombia international striker must be regretting his failed loan move to Manchester United.\n\nWhat evidence supports this claim?\nAccording to Dirar, Falcao's struggles to find his form at United since joining them on a season-long loan last summer are likely due to the devastating knee injury he suffered in January 2014 while playing for AS Monaco. Dirar also stated that United's reluctance to pay the £46million fee required to make the loan move permanent, suggests that the club likely has doubts about Falcao's ability to regain his previous form.",
        "Falcao was not happy in France during his loan spell with AS Monaco but believes that if he had stayed with Monaco he would have been happier in terms of the football and personal life.",
        "The aspect states that Falcao struggled for Manchester United during his loan spell and was not able to reach the heights he achieved before his knee injury. This indicates that the Colombian striker was not successful in performing to his potential while playing for the team on loan and the club is unlikely to make his move permanent through a £46million purchase. The core idea presented is that Falcao's performance did not meet expectations during his time with Manchester United.",
        "The aspect states that if Manchester United wants to make Radamel Falcao's transfer permanent, they will have to pay £46 million. This core idea highlights the financial cost that the club may have to bear in order to keep the striker beyond his loan agreement.",
        "The given aspect highlights that Manchester United are unlikely to pay the £46 million to make Radamel Falcao's loan permanent, given that he has only scored four goals this season. This suggests that the club may not consider Falcao to be a valuable enough player to invest such a large sum in, given his recent lack of performance."

    "answer": [
        "Sorry but i don't understand your question. Can you please phrases it in a clear sentence?",
        "It depends on which aspect of the summary you are referring to. The summary mainly discusses Falcao's loan period with Manchester United and his future with the club, but it does not directly mention his unhappiness in France or his preference to stay at Monaco.",
        "Yes, the aspect is present in the summary given. It is mentioned that Falcao joined Manchester United on a season-long loan last summer and that he has struggled to hit the heights he achieved before suffering a serious knee injury. The club would have to pay £46million to make the loan permanent, but this is unlikely to happen. All of these points are relevant to the aspect stating that Falcao struggled for United during his loan spell and was not able to reach the heights he achieved before his knee injury.",
        "No, the summary does not explicitly state the financial cost of making Falcao's transfer permanent. However, it does mention that there is a clause in the loan agreement that allows United to make the transfer permanent for £46 million. \nSo, the core idea of the aspect is hidden in the summary and cannot be deduced from the summary alone.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea, as it does not explicitly mention the likelihood of United not taking up the option to make Falcao's loan permanent."
