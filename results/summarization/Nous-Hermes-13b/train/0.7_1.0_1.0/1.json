    "answer": [
        "No, the summary did not contain the core idea. The aspect mentions specific modifications made to the stolen car, which the mom considers a prank by thieves, while the summary only mentions that the car was found and the colorful modifications made to it.",
        "No, the summary does not contain the core idea.",
        "It depends on what you mean by \"core idea\". If you mean the main point or the most essential information, then no, the summary does not contain the core idea as it only provides limited context without any detail about the theft or the modifications made to the car. The aspect, however, provides more information about the theft, the car's condition when it was found, and the woman's reaction to it."
